## üîß CORE REQUIREMENTS

### **HYPERREALISM STANDARDS**
```
Surface Textures    ‚Üí Specify material qualities (weathered leather, polished chrome, rough bark)
Atmospheric Detail  ‚Üí Include air particles (dust motes, steam, fog, pollen drifting)
Micro-Details      ‚Üí Reference fine elements (skin pores, fabric weave, metal scratches)
Depth of Field     ‚Üí Define focus points (sharp foreground, blurred background)
Imperfections      ‚Üí Add realistic flaws (asymmetry, wear patterns, natural aging)
```

### **CINEMATIC LIGHTING MASTERY**
```
Light Direction    ‚Üí Specify source position (harsh side-lighting, soft overhead glow)
Light Quality      ‚Üí Define character (hard shadows vs soft diffusion)
Color Temperature  ‚Üí Set mood (warm tungsten 3200K vs cool daylight 5600K)
Three-Point Setup  ‚Üí Key light + fill light + rim light for professional depth
Practical Sources  ‚Üí Include visible lights (neon signs, candles, phone screens)
```

### **16:9 COMPOSITION EXCELLENCE**
```
Horizontal Elements ‚Üí Use wide landscapes, architectural lines, panoramic views
Rule of Thirds     ‚Üí Position subjects along intersection points
Leading Lines      ‚Üí Guide eye with roads, fences, shorelines, building edges  
Layered Depth      ‚Üí Create distinct foreground, midground, background planes
Negative Space     ‚Üí Strategic empty areas for dramatic impact
```

## ‚úÖ PROMPT CONSTRUCTION FORMULA

### **STRUCTURE TEMPLATE**
```
[STRIKING SUBJECT] + [DETAILED SETTING] + [SPECIFIC LIGHTING] + 
[TEXTURE DESCRIPTIONS] + [ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS] + [TECHNICAL SPECS]
```

### **LANGUAGE HIERARCHY**
```
1. Lead with the most visually compelling element
2. Add tactile texture details you can almost feel  
3. Specify lighting direction and quality precisely
4. Include environmental storytelling elements
5. End with technical format specifications
```

### **SPECIFICITY EXAMPLES**
```
AVOID: "Beautiful sunset lighting"
USE:   "Golden hour backlighting casting long shadows through industrial scaffolding"

AVOID: "Detailed textures"  
USE:   "Salt-weathered wood planks with visible grain and rusted nail heads"

AVOID: "Cinematic quality"
USE:   "Three-point lighting with harsh key light and soft fill shadows"
```

## üì∏ PROFESSIONAL EXAMPLES

### **URBAN SCENE**
```
"A weathered street musician with calloused fingers plays violin beneath 
a flickering amber streetlamp, raindrops beading on wet cobblestones. 
Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting creates harsh shadows from above while neon 
reflections streak across the slick pavement. Steam rises from manholes, 
individual water droplets catch the tungsten glow. Shot with shallow depth 
of field, hyperrealistic textures showing fabric wear and metal oxidation. 
Composed in cinematic 16:9 format resembling film noir cinematography."
```

### **NATURAL LANDSCAPE**
```
"Ancient lighthouse stands against crashing Atlantic waves during golden 
hour, granite stones carved with salt spray patterns and barnacle growth. 
Side-lighting transforms water droplets into liquid diamonds while casting 
deep crevice shadows. Hyperrealistic detail captures foam bubble textures, 
weathered rope fibers, and individual sand grains. Atmospheric ocean haze 
softens the horizon while maintaining razor-sharp foreground elements. 
Professional 16:9 composition with epic landscape cinematography depth."
```

### **INTIMATE PORTRAIT**
```
"Master craftsman's scarred hands delicately repair antique pocket watch 
in dimly lit workshop, single brass lamp creating warm light pools against 
deep shadows. Every surface tells a story‚Äîcracked leather apron, tarnished 
gears catching light, worn workbench wood grain. Dust motes dance in amber 
illumination, individual tool marks visible on metal surfaces. Museum-quality 
hyperrealistic detail with documentary-style natural lighting. Framed in 
16:9 aspect ratio with intimate character-study cinematography."
```

## üé¨ PROFESSIONAL TERMINOLOGY BANK

### **LIGHTING KEYWORDS**
```
Rembrandt lighting    ‚Üí Dramatic diagonal shadow triangle on face
Chiaroscuro          ‚Üí High contrast light/dark dramatic effect  
Golden hour          ‚Üí Warm, low-angle natural sunlight
Practical lighting   ‚Üí Visible light sources within scene
Hard light           ‚Üí Sharp, defined shadows with clear edges
Soft light           ‚Üí Diffused, gradual shadow transitions
Backlighting         ‚Üí Light source behind subject creating rim effect
```

### **TEXTURE DESCRIPTORS**
```
WEATHERED: salt-stained, sun-bleached, wind-carved, time-patinated
CRAFTED:   hand-forged, machine-polished, laser-etched, tool-marked  
NATURAL:   bark-textured, stone-rough, silk-smooth, velvet-soft
WORN:      paint-chipped, rust-streaked, fabric-frayed, leather-cracked
```

### **ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS**
```
Air Quality: dust motes, steam wisps, fog banks, smoke tendrils
Particles:   pollen drifting, snow falling, rain droplets, ash floating
Moisture:    condensation beads, water spray, humid haze, frost crystals  
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### **PROBLEM: ARTIFICIAL APPEARANCE**
```
SYMPTOMS: Overly smooth, perfect symmetry, digital art look
SOLUTION: Add "weathered," "asymmetrical," "naturally aged," "film grain texture"
```

### **PROBLEM: FLAT LIGHTING**
```
SYMPTOMS: Even illumination, no shadows, lacks depth
SOLUTION: Specify "harsh side lighting," "deep shadow pools," "dramatic contrast"
```

### **PROBLEM: POOR 16:9 COMPOSITION**
```
SYMPTOMS: Vertical feeling, wasted space, centered subject
SOLUTION: Add "wide panoramic view," "horizontal leading lines," "expansive background"
```

### **PROBLEM: GENERIC STOCK PHOTO LOOK**
```
SYMPTOMS: Perfect models, clich√©d poses, overprofessional
SOLUTION: Include "candid moment," "individual character details," "environmental storytelling"
```

## ‚úì QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

```
‚ñ° Lighting source direction specified
‚ñ° Texture details that suggest touch
‚ñ° Atmospheric elements present  
‚ñ° Compositional guidance clear
‚ñ° Realistic imperfections included
‚ñ° 16:9 format considerations addressed
‚ñ° Professional terminology used
‚ñ° Specific rather than generic descriptors
```

## üîÑ ITERATION STRATEGY

### **PROGRESSIVE REFINEMENT**
```
VERSION 1: Basic scene + lighting + 16:9 format
VERSION 2: Add specific textures + atmospheric details
VERSION 3: Include imperfections + environmental storytelling  
VERSION 4: Fine-tune with professional cinematography terms
```

### **FAILED PROMPT DIAGNOSIS**
```
1. Identify weakest element (lighting/composition/realism)
2. Add 2-3 concrete descriptors for that element
3. Replace generic terms with specific details
4. Adjust primary lighting description
5. Test with modified version
```

## ‚ö° DALL¬∑E 3 TECHNICAL LIMITS

```
Optimal Length:     200-400 words (longer prompts truncated)
Focus Limit:        1-2 main subjects maximum
Text Rendering:     Avoid readable text expectations  
Conflicting Info:   Don't contradict lighting/style directions
Brand References:   Avoid copyrighted names/characters
```

## üöÄ MASTER FORMULA

```
START BOLD ‚Üí BUILD ATMOSPHERE ‚Üí ADD TEXTURES ‚Üí DEFINE LIGHTING ‚Üí TECHNICAL SPECS ‚Üí IMPERFECTIONS
```

### **FINAL SUCCESS PRINCIPLE**
Write prompts like detailed cinematographer's shooting notes, not simple scene descriptions. Specificity and professional terminology consistently produce superior hyperrealistic results.
