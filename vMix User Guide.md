Getting Started

A screenshot of the vMix user interface below.

This main window is where all the video mixing takes place.
If you have used traditional video switchers before, the main window might look familiar. There are four main elements:
Output Window
(Top-Right hand corner with the Green Title Bar)

This is the Live or Program video output window. This output is also displayed in a Fullscreen window that defaults to the computer's secondary display.
This output is also what is used when setting up a recording.

Preview Window
(Top-Left hand corner with the Orange Title Bar)

Just like a traditional video mixer, an input you wish to display should be placed in this preview window first. The Preview Window swaps with the Output Window whenever you select the Cut, Fade or Transition buttons, located along the center.

Tabs


Colour coded tabs on the left hand side can be used to organise Inputs into categories and tabs on the right hand side can be used to dock features such as the Audio Mixer and Instant Replay Controller

Input Bar
(Bottom row)

Each source such as Camera, Video and all other types of Inputs are loaded into this Input Bar. A small real-time preview window is shown for each of these inputs.

If you click any of these items they will be queued in the Preview Window ready to go. If you double click any of these items the Input Settings window will be displayed.
Multiple rows of inputs can also be displayed at a time. See Inputs to find out more.

Footer Bar (Bottom)
Along the bottom are buttons to Add Input and buttons to configure and start features such as
Recordings, Streams and External Output.




Presets


The Preset bar at the top left hand corner of vMix is where you can quickly save your production, including Inputs, recording and streaming settings to file.
This Preset can then be recalled again at a moments notice. Each Preset contains the following information:
Each input and it's associated input settings (including positions, colour adjustments, chroma key, multiview etc)
Recording settings
Overlay settings
Any shortcut keys assigned as local
Any activators assigned as local
Audio settings for each input and all three audio buses (Master, A and B)
All PlayLists, including the active PlayList if applicable
Category labels
Streaming settings. All existing streaming profiles and settings will be replaced with the settings from when the Preset was last saved
External Output settings including Size, Frame Rate and Device, as per corresponding tab in Settings
Outputs configuration (for example if MultiView is selected for Fullscreen) as per corresponding tab in Settings
Data Sources and related settings

In addition to the above, if the Preset was saved with a different Master Frame Rate or Output Size then what is currently configured (1920x1080 29.97p for example)
then a message will appear asking to confirm these changes.

Any media used by inputs including Videos, Images, Photos, Title templates etc will be referred to by filename only.
So if the Preset is used on a different system, be sure to copy any media assets and place them in the same folder locations.

All other settings can be saved and recalled from the Settings Import/Export buttons





New Preset
Creates a new blank Preset and optionally changes the current output video format.



Open Preset
Open Preset opens up a file open dialog where you can select an existing Preset. Once a Preset has been selected the Open Preset window will appear.

Click Open to close all open inputs and replace them with this Preset.
Any settings included with the Preset will also be applied (See here for more information)

Click Append to add the inputs in this Preset to the existing session.
Any settings included with the Preset will be ignored.


Each input can be unticked if you want to exclude it from being added

Recent Presets
Quickly open a recent preset by clicking the arrow button next to the Open button.



Last Preset
Periodically, vMix automatically saves the current Preset to a separate file. Click Last to load this Preset

Video Controls

The Preview Window and Output Window have various video controls available:

Position Control

For non-live inputs (such as Video and DVD) the position control allows you to skip to any point.

Restart Button

Restarts a non-live input (such as Video or DVD) from the beginning.

Play/Pause Button

Fullscreen

The Fullscreen button can be used to display video through one of the video outputs on your computer Graphics Card.
These can be connected to displays such as Monitors, Projectors and TVs.


First, connect these displays to your computer prior to opening vMix and make sure they are configured as
"Extend these displays" in the Screen Resolution control panel in Windows.
See Windows 10 Display Instructions on the Microsoft web site for further instructions. Second, select the display from Settings under the Display tab as shown below:




By default the Fullscreen will display the final mixed output of vMix. Click the arrow to the right of the
Fullscreen button to select a different output option:

Output
The final mixed output of vMix, this is also shown on the right hand side of vMix.

Preview
Display the input currently selected in the "Preview" area of vMix (left hand side).

MultiView
Display Preview, Output and 8 or more Inputs in one of the configurations below. All configurations with the exception of Legacy include audio meters and titles.

Preview / Output + 8 Inputs


Preview / Output + 14 Inputs


Preview / Output + 2 Inputs


Legacy

Preview / Output + 8 Inputs without titles and audio meters.
The Preview and Output inputs will be identified by a coloured border.


Input X
Display the input at position X

Multiple Outputs
vMix 4K supports up to two Fullscreen outputs.
The second Fullscreen output is available on graphics cards that support three simultaneous displays.

Transitions

Quick Play Cut
Fade / Transition Buttons Merge Effect
Stinger Transitions FTB (Fade To Black)

Quick Play


The Quick Play button automatically transitions the Preview Window to the Output Window and for video inputs, starts playing input from current position.
There is also a Quick Play button for each input.

By default Quick Play is set to a half second fade. This can be customised in Settings - Options


Cut

The Cut button instantly swaps the Preview Window with the Output Window without any delay or transition effect.

Fade/Transition Buttons
vMix provides four customisable buttons that can be used to set the transition effect when switching from Preview to Output


Click the arrow next to each button to customise the transition effect and the duration.
The Stinger 1 and Stinger 2 can be configured in the Overlay settings. See Stinger Transitions

The first effect button also determines the transition used by the Fade Bar / T-Bar.



Merge Effect
The Merge effect is a unique transition effect that seamlessly animates matching Inputs between Preview and Output.


In the above example, clicking the Merge transition will zoom the fireworks graphic out of the double box until it fills the screen.
Any other layers or inputs that do not appear in both Preview and Output will transition using the Fade transition effect.


Stinger Transitions

Note: Stinger Transitions are only supported on vMix editions with more than one Overlay channel such as vMix HD.

Stinger Transitions allow the use of an animation instead of a fade or cut when transition between Preview and Output.

Configuration
Add the animation you wish to use as an Input. The Image Sequence option is recommended as it supports high quality animations with full alpha transparency.
In the Overlay settings window, select Stinger 1 from the Number dropdown box.
Configure the following settings:

Effect: This specifies an additional effect when transitioning to and from the stinger transition. In most cases this will be set to Cut
Duration: Specify the total duration of the animation in milliseconds or frames. This will usually be the length of the animation.
Stinger Input: Select the Input added in step 1
Stinger Cut Point: Specify the point in time when the transition will cut between the Preview and Output inputs. If your animation has alpha channel, this will usually be the point where the animation covers the entire screen.
Display underneath overlays: Tick this box if the stinger transition should appear underneath any overlays (1-4) currently on screen.

Once all your settings have been configured click OK.

Using the Stinger Transition
In the main window, select Stinger 1 as one of the four transition buttons in the middle of the screen.




When the stinger transition is required, simply click the transition button as you would any other effect

FTB (Fade To Black)
Fade to black the following:

Recordings
External Output
Fullscreen

The Output window will not be affected by the Fade to black in order to make it easier to queue up a source for later.

Production Clocks

Getting Started
Two production clocks are available which can enabled by ticking the Production Clocks checkbox in
Settings -> Options
A 1920x1080 display or higher is recommended, as the Production Clocks will be hidden if there is no space available below the T-Bar.
Other elements above the Production Clocks can be disabled from Settings -> Options as well in order to free up space.

Overview
Two production clocks can be configured to independently display two of the following options:

Clock: The current time with an optional hour offset to show a different time zone.
Event: The remaining time before, during and after predetermined event times.
Recording: The total duration so far of any active recording.
Streaming: The total duration so far of any active streams.

Settings
Double click the Production Clocks display below the T-Bar to open the Settings window.


The two clocks available can be configured from the 1 and 2 buttons which represent the Top and Bottom clocks on the display respectively.

Inverted: By default the display will have a black background. Click the Inverted button to switch this to white.

Type: Select the type of time to display out of Clock, Event, Recording and Streaming.

Precision: Determine how accurate the time is that is displayed out of Minutes, Seconds and Fractions. The font size will automatically decrease at higher accuracies so the entire time will still be displayed, so if a bigger font
is desirable select Minutes here.

Clock Settings
Hour offset: Select an offset, positive or negative in hours, to add to the current system time before display. AM/PM: Tick to show the time in 12 hour format with AM or PM next to the time on the display, otherwise display in 24 hour format.

Event Settings
Start/End: Select a start time and optionally an end time for the event. Before the Start time, the clock will show a countdown in amber.
With End Time

During the event, the clock will show a green countdown.
After the End Time, the clock will show a red of the duration since the event ended.

Without End Time

After the Start time, the clock will show a green duration.

Create Input
Create Input will create a high resolution version of the clocks as a standard vMix input, allowing it to be displayed
on the MultiView Output or on outputs such as Fullscreen.

If the "Cameras / Calls / Audio Inputs" tickbox is enabled in Settings -> Outputs / NDI this input will also be available
via NDI for display anywhere on the local network.

Note: Only one Production Clocks input can be created at a time.

Categories

Inputs can be placed into up to six (6) different colour coded categories. These categories can be selected from the left hand side of the Inputs Row


The six categories are RED, GREEN, ORANGE, PURPLE, AQUA and BLUE
Each colour has no special significance and can be used for any purpose that suits your production.
For example, Titles could be placed in the PURPLE category and Video Clips in the ORANGE category.

Adding Labels to Categories

Labels can be added to particular categories by right clicking any category button so the Input Categories
window appears.


Once the labels have been added, click OK and the the buttons will change as follows:



View All Inputs
All inputs can be viewed at any time by clicking the left most button. This button is GREY under the default vMix theme.

Currently Selected Category

The currently selected category will be indicated by a matching coloured separating line between the category buttons and the inputs as shown below.



Changing An Input's Category
There are two ways to change an Input's category:

Drag and drop the inputs preview window (the video thumbnail square, not the title) over the top of the category button you wish to assign it to.
Select the Category from the Input Settings window.

When an Input has been assigned to a particular category, the Input Settings button will be changed to a matching colour.


Fade Bar

The Fade Bar (also known as a T-Bar) just below the FTB button allows you to manually transition from the Preview Window and the Output Window.
The transition effect used is taken from the first Transition button. See Fade/Transition Buttons

When unchecked, vMix will start up with empty data sources each time, only loading data sources when opened as part of a previously saved preset.





Performance
Graphics Adapter
This displays the graphics card vMix is using systems with multiple graphics cards installed.
For best performance this should match the graphics card that monitor displaying the vMix interface is attached to.

For laptops with hybrid graphics (also known as NVIDIA Optimus), the graphics card shown here can only be changed from the NVIDIA control panel. It cannot be selected or changed from within vMix directly.

Low Latency Capture
This will reduce the latency of Camera inputs by approximately one frame.
This will substantially increase the load on the graphics card and may lead to dropped frames under heavy load, so it should used with caution.

High Input Performance Mode
If you plan on using a large number of cameras (typically > 8) and a large number of inputs, performance can be improved by ticking this checkbox.
Note that this only works on graphics cards with a large amount of built in memory (3GB+) and will result in poor performance if enabled on graphics cards with less memory, or Intel graphics.

Disable Windows Update while vMix is running


Windows Update may automatically install updates to the computer in the background at any time.
This option will disable Windows Update while vMix is running in order to avoid any potential performance drops as a result of windows installing updates during a production.

Display Method
This option selects the method by which vMix presents video to the computer display (both for Preview/ Output windows and the Fullscreen outputs).
Note that these options do not impact the recording / stream / external outputs in any way, and only apply to the outputs on the graphics card.

Auto Let vMix select the best option based on the current settings. This will usually be the same as selecting Low Latency for frame rates less than 30 and Smooth otherwise.
Low Latency Displays video as fast as possible to the computer display to ensure the lowest possibly latency. Video playback may be less than smooth as a result.
Smooth vMix will make every effort to ensure the video playback is as smooth as possible on the display but may add a couple of frames of delay as a result.
Legacy Use the display method employed by vMix 20 and earlier.












Decoders
Preferred Deinterlacing

Select the preferred deinterlacing method, when using Progressive output formats in vMix.
For example, if you have a camera set to 59.94i and the Master Frame Rate is set to 29.97p, then vMix will deinterlace the camera according to the settings here.

Blend: Blends the two fields together to form a single progressive frame. Motion blur may be seen on fast movement.
Discard: Uses the first field for each frame and discards the second. No motion blur during fast movement, lower vertical resolution than Blend.

FFMPEG

Select the file formats that will be played using the built in FFMPEG decoder. QuickTime files and MXF files are enabled by default.

Note: This option is only available under the 64bit version of vMix.

DirectShow

Select custom decoders to be used for various video formats. It is recommended that these be set to Auto.

MPEG 2 Video

Select a custom MPEG 2 codec to use when playing DVDs and MPG files.

Use vMix Deinterlacing

Tick this box to automatically set deinterlacing in vMix for DVD/MPG sources.
Set this option only if the selected MPEG 2 codec does not support deinterlacing. (such as the codec included with Windows 7)

MPEG Audio
Select a custom MPEG audio codec to use when playing DVDs and MPG files.

x264 Video
Select a custom video codec to use when playing x264, (h264) sources.

Filters - Blocked Filter List
This feature can be used to enable/disable problematic directshow filters from use within vMix. By default ffdshow is disabled.


Recording
Default Folder for Recordings
Select a default folder to use when storing recorded videos.

Filename Format
The filename format is for advanced users that need to change the way video recordings are named. The default is {0} - {1:dd MMMM yyyy - hh-mm-ss tt}

Recording Memory Buffer
Set the memory buffer to use when recording video. This can be used to reduce dropped frames on systems with slow hard drives.

The recommended value is 10.

Automatically Setup Recording With Previous Settings
This will automatically configure the recording using the last known settings when clicking Start in the main vMix window.





External Output




vMix Video / Streaming
Select this option to output to the vMix Video device when External Output is running.

vMix Video is a device that appears in 3rd party applications such as Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder
and Skype and is also used for the built in Streaming feature.

Use Streaming Settings: When ticked this option will match the streaming quality settings and should remain ticked for the best results when streaming.

See Streaming

External Renderer
Select this option to send video and audio out to compatible output devices.
Some examples of hardware that support output including most AJA, Blackmagic Design and BlueFish devices.

Use Display Settings: When ticked this option will match the Frame Rate and Output Size settings under the Display tab at all times.

See External Output for more information.

External 2
In vMix 4K and Pro a second independent output can be configured for both vMix Video and External Renderer.
This vMix Video device is called vMix Video External 2 in 3rd party applications.

Frame Rate
Select the Frame Rate for the External Output. When using the External Renderer this should be set to the frame rate required by the device's output.
For vMix Video / Streaming, this should be set to the Master Frame Rate set under the Display tab for

optimal performance.

Output Size
Resolution for the External Output. This must be set to the output format when using the External Renderer. For example if using the Composite/S-Video output this will usually be 720x576 for PAL and 720x480 for NTSC.

Device (External only)
Select the output device to use. (Such as the AJA Kona 4)

Port (External only)
Select the Port to use on the output device, for example HDMI or SDI.

Audio Device (External only)
Some output devices require selecting an Audio Device as well which can be selected here. If this option is not visible, then the audio will automatically be included.

Audio Channels (External only)
See Output Audio Channels

Audio Delay
This sets a delay on the audio input in milliseconds. For example if the audio is earlier than the video by 200ms, type in 200 here.


Audio


Automatically mix audio
By default vMix will automatically swap the active audio to match the active input.
If this box is unticked, vMix will leave the audio as is and any changes will need to be done manually.

Show Master Audio Meter in Main Window
Display a master audio meter in the middle of the main window.

Show Audio Meter next to Inputs
Each input with an audio source can have a stereo audio meter displayed beside it.

Fade To Black includes Audio
When selecting the FTB (Fade To Black) option in vMix, the audio will fade in or out if this option is ticked.

Default Input Audio Delay
Set an audio delay value in milliseconds to apply to all inputs added to vMix by default. This can be useful to offset an audio delay of an audio mixer. See Recording Audio.

Audio Gap Handling
Audio clocks from various sources can run at slightly different rates. For example an audio source running only 0.5% slower than vMix will be missing 5ms of audio every second.
This setting defines how vMix handles these gaps in audio from the source.

Drop: This is the default and involves vMix placing a gap of silence to make up time. This results in a short usually inaudible "drop" in the audio.
Resample: Audio will be stretched over time to compensate for the different timing. The side effect of this is a very slight, imperceptible change in pitch.



Audio Outputs


Audio Outputs allows up to eight independently controllable audio outputs (excluding Headphones output) If both Master Output and Headphones are set to the same device, Headphones will take priority.

Master Output
Select the output to send the Master audio mix to. This is the default audio mix

used for streaming, recording and external output.

Headphones
Select the output to send the Headphones audio mix to.

This mix is the same as Master Output except when Solo is enabled on an input. When Solo is enabled on an input only that input will be heard.

A, B, C, D, E, F, G
These are optionally auxiliary audio buses that can be configured as an independent mix from the Audio Mixer.

For additional information about the audio buses feature, see the Audio Mixer documentation.

Audio Channels
Many sound cards provide 3 or more stereo outputs from a single device.
These are typically used to output surround sound, but can be used to output up to three independent stereo audio mixes in vMix.

1 + 2 The most common setting for standard stereo audio outputs
3 + 4 This will send a stereo mix out over the output usually used for Center-Subwoofer
5 + 6 This will send a stereo mix out over the output usually used for RearLeft-RearRight

VST devices may offer more than 3 outputs in mono or stereo (1+2) configurations which can also be selected here.
When selecting a mono output, the stereo mix in vMix will be mixed down to mono automatically.

Default Bus for New Inputs
Advanced audio scenarios may require inputs to be sent to an auxiliary bus such as A and B when they are added for the first time.
This default can be configured here.






Web Controller
See the Web Controller section for information about this tab.


Tally Lights
This section will cover using Tally Lights with Arduino based hardware. For other tally light options see Tally Lights

The Tally Lights settings can be used to specify the pin numbers for each tally light when using Arduino based hardware.

Reset to Default: Reset to the default pin order as of vMix 2012 v4.
Reset to Legacy Mode: Revert to the pin order used in all previous versions of vMix.

NDI / Desktop Capture is used to add two types of sources into vMix:

NDI

Easily add audio and video sources on the local network that support the NDI standard.
This also includes capturing remote desktops on PCs and Macs using vMix Desktop Capture.

Local Desktop Capture





NDI - Network Device Interface


NDI is an easy way to send and receive high quality, low latency video and audio between supported devices using a standard Gigabit enabled network.
For example you can produce one aspect of your show on one computer and send the output to vMix running on another.

You can also add any NDI enabled source to vMix as long as it is on the same network. This might be a NDI enabled hardware device
or another computer or laptop running 3rd party software that supports the NDI standard.

Adding NDI Inputs
Sources detected on the network will appear automatically in the list with a preview thumbnail and organised by device or computer name as shown below.




In the screenshot above, there are four NDI sources available across two different computers.

Adding Remote Desktops
You can bring into vMix the desktop of a remote PC or Mac simply by downloading and running the free vMix Desktop Capture application from the vMix web site. http://www.vmix.com/software/download.aspx

While the vMix Desktop Capture program is running, any windows open on that computer will appear in the NDI list.
In the screenshot above, Microsoft PowerPoint is running on a laptop called "THUNDER1" and can be added to vMix simply by double clicking it from the list.

vMix Desktop Capture Features

Capture multiple displays, windows at high quality and in full resolution
Games can now be captured from computers running Windows 8 or higher, including fullscreen games powered by Direct3D or OpenGL.
Audio is captured automatically
The mouse cursor is also captured

NOTE: users running versions of vMix Desktop Capture older than 17 will need to upgrade the software to the latest version

Changing NDI source through right click menu
Once the initial NDI source or desktop capture has been added, a right click menu is available to change the source at any time.



Additional Settings
Low Bandwidth Mode: This will switch NDI to use a low resolution / low bandwidth version of the source video.
Audio Only: Disable video, only bring in audio from NDI source.
PsF: If NDI source is a camera that sends progressive over interlaced video, tick this box to improve video quality.
Increase Buffer Size: On unstable/wireless networks, ticking this option can improve the smoothness of the video. Will increase latency by approximately 5 frames.


Local Desktop Capture
Adding Local Desktops
From the NDI / Desktop Capture tab, a tab called Local Desktop Capture can be selected to capture the screen or window from the same computer.
This enables high performance full frame rate capture of any active window, including windows hidden behind vMix or running on a separate display.

This is great for capturing programs like Skype.


Windows 7 Note: "Aero" theme must be enabled in order to capture individual windows.

Windows 8 or higher will always work when capturing individual windows regardless of theme.

Window Capture Method
Select the method used to capture individual Windows.
GDI: This will work on the vast majority of systems with the exception of Windows Store apps and browsers such as FireFox and Chrome.
WindowsGraphicsCapture: This is available on Windows 10 1809 or higher and captures most applications including browsers and Windows Store apps.
DWM: This is available on earlier versions of Windows 10 and Windows 7 and can capture the same windows as GDI but with slightly lower CPU/GPU resource usage.




Desktop Capture
For Desktop Capture support in vMix, see the NDI / Desktop Capture topic.


Stream / SRT
The Stream input supports adding IP Cameras and Streaming Servers that support the RTSP, Transport Stream or SRT protocols.


Stream Type
RTSP over UDP / RTSP over TCP

RTSP based sources such as the Teradek Cube and IP Cameras Enter the URL in the following format: rtsp://0.0.0.0/stream1
Transport Stream over UDP

Select this option if a Transport Stream is being sent directly to the vMix machine over UDP Enter the port number of the stream
Transport Stream over TCP

Selecting this option sets up vMix as a TCP server that can accept connections from remote streams Enter the port to listen for connections

Transport Stream over TCP Pull


Select this option to connect to a remote Transport Stream server such as the Teradek Sputnik using the TCP protocol.
Enter the hostname and port of the remote Transport Stream server

VLC

The VLC option uses the free VLC Media Player software to connect to the stream.
This requires installing a special version of VLC which can be downloaded and installed from here:
http://www.vmix.com/vlcdownload

vMix currently supports only RTMP, UDP, RTP, RTSP and TS streams using this method. Other stream types such as HLS and M3U8 are not supported.

SRT (Caller, Listener, Rendezvous) See SRT Input for more information
Buffer
The network buffer in milliseconds can be configured to reduce jitter when receiving high latency network streams.
For local network streams, this should be set between 0 and 500 milliseconds or 1000 to 5000 milliseconds for Internet streams.

Low Latency Mode
Local streaming devices such as the Teradek cube support a delay of less than 5 frames in Low Latency Mode.
To use this mode, set the Buffer to 0 and tick the Low Latency Mode checkbox.

NOTE: If this option is enabled and the stream does not support Low Latency the video will show compression artefacts and will play back at a lower frame rate.

Video and Audio Formats
H264 AAC-HBR

Network Formats
RTSP
RTP (UDP and TCP)
TS (UDP, TCP and TCP Pull)

Firewall
UDP ports 35000 to 35500 will need to be open on your Firewall in order to receive streams in vMix.

SRT
To connect to an SRT source, select the Stream / SRT option from the Add Input window and select either SRT (Caller), SRT (Listener) or SRT (Rendezvous) from the Stream Type dropdown.




The following settings are available:


Stream Type
Listener: Listen on the specified Port on all network adapters on the computer for connections. Hostname is ignored.
Caller: Connect to the specified Hostname and Port.
Rendezvous: Connect to the specified Hostname and Port. The other side must also be set to Rendezvous with an identical port number specified.
This mode allows connecting through most firewalls automatically.

Latency
Specify the latency of the connection in milliseconds to adapt to network congestion. The higher this value, the better SRT can handle difficult network conditions.
As a general rule this should be set to at least 4x the ping time destination IP. So 20ms would require a latency setting of at least 80
This must be set to the same value on both ends.

Decoder Delay
Some encoders may not send evenly spaced frames, also known as jitter. Encoders may also send audio long before or after the associated video frame.
To compensate for this, a Decoder Delay can be configured to allow for any potential jitter on the encoder side.
For example if frames may arrive 100ms apart, set the decoder delay here to at least 150.

Passphrase
Specify a password to encrypt the connection. This password must be used by both sides for the connection to be established.

Key Length

This is the encryption strength to use. Multiple by 8 to convert to bits, for example 32 = 256bit encryption.

Stream ID
Optional Stream ID that may be required by your streaming provider to uniquely identify the stream.

Use Hardware Decoder
Use accelerated decoding where available on the graphics card. The majority of modern graphics cards support both H264 and HEVC hardware decoding.
vMix will fall back to CPU decoding where available.


MultiCorder Recordings
Due to SRT using an already compressed video stream (in Transport Stream .ts format)
Any MultiCorder recordings of this input will save the stream directly to file without using the compression settings specified in the MultiCorder window.

Instant Replay
Full documentation on Instant Replay can be found below:

Instant Replay User Guide

Image Sequence / Stinger
Image Sequence / Stinger can be used to automatically load a series of images as an animation.
This feature can be used to create animations with or without alpha channels that can be used as Overlays or Stingers in vMix.

vMix will automatically search for the next image in the list based on the filename of the selected file.
For example if the image is called image1.png then vMix will load image2.png, image3.png and so on, until no more files can be found.

Sound
Sound can be added to an image sequence by creating an MP3 or WAV file and naming it to match the first image in the sequence.
For example if the first image is image1.png then the sound file should be called image1.png.wav or image1.png.mp3
This sound file will need to be in the same folder as the rest of the images. The sound will then start playing each time the Image Sequence is played.
NOTE: When adding sound to an existing image sequence, the input will need to be added to vMix again for it to be detected.

Video Delay
The Video Delay Input allows you to select a custom delay to the Output or a Capture Input. This feature can be used to achieve many types of effects including slow motion replay.

Setup


Source: Select either Output or an Input such as a Video Camera
Resolution: Select the quality of the Video Delay. If you select a video camera to delay, this option will be the same as the camera resolution.

Change the direction of the Countdown so it counts up instead.

Virtual Set
The Virtual Set features provides the ability to integrate a chroma keyed live camera and other graphic elements into a real-time 3D rendered virtual set.
This virtual set can then be smoothly zoomed and panned just like in a live television studio.

Setup

Choose from one of the built-in Virtual Set presets to add it to vMix.
Each will show a placeholder image giving an idea of where the camera and other elements will be located within the virtual set.

Control
Each Virtual Set has two tabs that can be used for customisation.

Camera

The Camera Tab provides thumbnail previews of the camera angles available within the Virtual Set. To switch to a camera angle, simply click on the thumbnail.
To customise the camera angle, right click on the thumbnail.

The speed of the camera zoom is determined by the F (Fast), M (Medium), S (Slow) and C (Cut) buttons above the thumbnail previews.

Setup


The Setup Tab can be used to adjust the various layers that form a complete Virtual Set.

Layer: Select the layer, such as a background to adjust.
Input: If a layer supports cameras (such as the Talent layer) or video clips (such as the Screen layer), the

input can be selected here.

While in the Setup Tab the mouse can be used to click and drag on the preview window to change the location of the layer.
Hold down the Shift key to resize the layer.

Reset Position: Revert the layers position and scale to the default setting.
Visible: Toggle on or off this layer. This can be used to hide desk in some Virtual Sets.



Web Browser
Use the Web Browser input to add any web page to vMix.

Settings
URL
Type in the full web page URL that you wish to display. For example: http://www.vmix.com/

Width, Height
Specify the Width and Height in pixels when rendering the web page.

If these are set to a size smaller than the vMix Output Size, the web page will initially be displayed centred and at the reduced size.
This is handy for HTML widgets you may wish to use as Overlays as they will show at the correct size and simply need to be moved into position
from Input Settings - Position.

Mouse Control

Once added, the web page can be controlled by clicking and dragging the mouse on either the Input window or the Preview/Output within vMix.

Keyboard Control
Keyboard use within the web page can be enabled by right clicking the input and selecting the Keyboard Enabled option.
IMPORTANT: When this option is enabled, keyboard shortcuts in vMix will no longer be active. To enable the keyboard shortcuts again, right click the web page and disable the Keyboard Enabled option.

Transparency

The Web Browser input in vMix supports transparent backgrounds and alpha channel when used by sites such as TwitchAlerts.
To create your own page with transparent background, simply create a page where the background colour for the <body> element is not specified.

Right Click Menu

Right click on the Web Browser input to Go Back, Go Forward or change the web page from the Properties window.

Media

The Web Browser Input utilises the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) and has most of the features available in the Google Chrome browser.
This includes HTML5 video and audio playback and other media features such as WebRTC.

Audio

Audio is fully supported with the Web Browser input and can be independently mixed just like any other audio source in vMix, no desktop audio capture needed.

Video Call See vMix Call Mix
The Mix input allows adding up to three additional "mini mixers" that support basic transitions and cuts
between two different inputs.
To add a Mix input, click the arrow next to Add Input in the main vMix window and click the Mix option.


Note: Mix is only available in 4K and Pro editions of vMix.

Once added, the input looks like the following:



The Preview and Output dropdown boxes can be used to select the inputs you wish to mix.
Cut will cut between the inputs and Fade will transition between the inputs. Click the arrow next to Fade to customise the transition effect.

Input Preview
The input preview window will always show both the Preview and Output window side by side in the vMix window
and in the MultiView Output.
All other outputs will only show the mixed Output as expected, as demonstrated below:



Shortcuts
The following shortcuts can be used with an optional Mix parameter, where 1 is equal to the main mix in vMix and 2 is equal to the first Mix input.

PreviewInput

ActiveInput
Fade, Zoom, Wipe etc

Restrictions
The Mix input is intended as a basic video mixer/switcher only, as a result the following features are not available:

Stinger transitions
Overlays (inputs can still be setup manually through the standard input MultiView feature)
Auto play/pause/restart of inputs. (This is to prevent unexpected situations where inputs are used by both the main mix and an input mix)
Audio auto mixing.
T-Bar transitions
Input Buttons
Input Buttons are the buttons available underneath each input.


Close
Close the Input and remove it from the Input Bar.

Quick Play
Fades directly to the Output Window and for video inputs, starts playing input from current position.

Sharpen: Sharpen blurry video. (This requires a high end Graphics Card) Mirror: Horizontal mirror

Automatically mix audio
Automatically Play/Restart/Pause with Transition Audio Settings

Create Virtual Input
Copies the settings and contents of this input into a new Input.

The Virtual Input depends on the original input in order to display video, so if a camera input is closed any virtual inputs created from that camera will become blank.

Colour Adjust
Black Stretch: Increase the black level of the video.

White Stretch: Increase the white level (or brightness) of the video. Red / Green / Blue: Independently adjust the rgb channels of the video. Alpha: Independently adjust the transparency of the video.
Saturation: Drag this bar to the right to increase colour saturation or drag it to the left to convert colours into black and white (greyscale).

Premultiplied Alpha: Tick this box if the source is using premultiplied alpha which is often the case with MOV and other video formats containing an alpha channel.
Colour Correction
vMix allows professional colour correction for every input in addition to the basic tools provided by the Colour Adjust tab.




Colour correction is achieved using the industry standard Lift, Gamma and Gain controls as described below:

Lift: adjusts the dark areas of the image the most (such as shadows)
Gamma: adjusts the colours half way between black and white the most (e.g mid-tones)
Gain: adjusts the bright areas of the image the most (such as highlights)

Basic Auto Correct

The Basic Auto Correct button will automatically adjust the Lift and Gain controls to their optimal levels.

Reset Button

Press the reset button to to reset the levels to default.

Colour Wheel / Luminance Bar
Drag the white circle in the direction of the colours you wish to boost in the image.


To adjust all colours equally, drag up or down the bar on the right of the colour wheel.

Colour Bars


Press the top button labelled "Display: Colour Wheels" to switch to colour bar mode.


Each of these three bars can be dragged up and down to adjust the Red, Green and Blue levels of the image respectively.

Hue / Saturation
Drag these bars left or right to adjust the image Hue or Saturation respectively.

Presets

A file containing the Lift, Gamma, Gain, Hue and Saturation settings can be imported and exported from the Presets menu for use in other productions.

Colour Correction Tutorial
The easiest way to visualise how these controls work is to turn on the Parade RGB Waveform Monitor as shown below:


A typical video source in need of correction may look something like the following:




The red green and blue channels will typically look quite similar. In this example however, we can see the highlights (top of each waveform)
are well below optimal brightness.

To adjust these channels so they match, change the colour wheels to colour bars by pressing the "Display: Colour Wheels" button.


Next, slowly drag the red green and blue bars below the Gain heading upwards until the waveforms reach the top line.



Lift can be used to drag the waveforms towards the bottom line, and finally Gamma can be used to adjust the waveform
around the middle of the image.

Switching back to Colour Wheels allows us to see how these adjustments look from a different perspective.




As you can see the colour has been shifted slightly towards the blue/green, with a small amount of overall brightness added to all colour channels.
(Black/White bar to the right of the colour wheel)
Colour Key
Colour Key can be used to select a transparent colour when using an input as an Overlay or inside a Virtual Set.

This option can also be used with a green screen, see the options below for more information. Select:	Manually select the colour that will be made transparent.
Auto Colour Key:	Brings up a window a colour can be selected directly from the currently displaying input.
Tolerance: 	Set how close vMix should match to the Red/Green/Blue values in the colour key. The sliders all the way to the left represent an exact match.

Chroma Key:	Move this slider slightly to the right to improve the colour key quality when a green/blue screen is being used.
Chroma Key Filter:	Removes green/blue halos from an image when using a green screen. The scroll bar can also be used to increase the transparency of the green elements.

Auto Chroma Key Presets: Click the 1, 2 or 3 button presets to automatically select settings suitable for use with a green/blue screen.
Depending on your green screen setup some of these presets may work better than others. The sliders can then be adjusted slightly to fine tune.

Advanced Chroma Key
To achieve a high quality chroma key:

Click Auto Colour Key at the top of the window and select a colour.
Click Auto Chroma Key towards the bottom of the window.
Drag the Chroma Key slider all the way to the right, this will initially appear to decrease the effectiveness of the colour key until step 4 is utilised below.
Drag the Chroma Key Filter slider towards the right to increase the transparency of the background.
If objects or actors appear transparent, try dragging back the Chroma Key slider and repeating step 4 until the most effective combination has been found.
Click Anti Aliasing if jagged edges appear.

Luma Key
Luma Key is used to key out the background based on brightness or luminance. For example white text on black background.

Key/Fill Input
Select another input to use as the Key channel for this input.
The input selected should be grey scale with black representing fully transparent (0) and white as opaque (255).

Layer / Multi View

Overview


Select up to 10 inputs to display together in one of the selected configurations. For example, split screen and picture in picture.

Each of these inputs can be positioned by dragging the windows within the preview box at the bottom of the window.
Hold down shift while dragging to resize each input. Alternatively click one of the Edit buttons to adjust manually from the Position tab..

Once the positions have been configured, the Add button on the right hand side can be used to create a template.
This template will be saved outside of vMix presets and sessions allowing custom templates to be used in multiple productions.

NOTE: When selecting inputs that have layers of their own, only two layers deep will be rendered.
E.G the input, it's layers, and the layers within those layers will be rendered only.

Import
Import from file a previously exported layout. This layout contains information such as the position, border and cropping of all 10 layers.

Export
Export the position, border and cropping of all 10 layers to file. This can then be imported on other systems as needed.

Add
Click Add to save the current position, border and cropping of all 10 layers to the list of templates.

Remove
Click Remove to remove the current selected template from the list.

Show / Hide
It is possible to hide a Layer while keeping its settings by unchecking the checkbox

Move / Change Order
Layers can be moved to different numbers by dragging and dropping the number boxes.


Moving a Layer will change its order while preserving all position and cropping information.
This is useful in situations where you want to move an Input so that it appears "on top" of another where 10 is the top most layer.
(This is also known as the Z-Index, or Z-Order)


Layer 10 will always appear on top of Layer 9, Layer 9 on top of Layer 8 and so on.

Edit
Click edit next to a layer to edit settings such as position, crop and border.

Position
Zoom: Zoom in or out.
Pan X: Pan from left to right Pan Y: Pan from top to bottom
Rotate: Rotate image from right to left. Crop X1: Crop from the left hand side Crop X2: Crop from the right hand side Crop Y1: Crop from the top
Crop Y2: Crop from the bottom

Each of these options can also be changed for one of the 10 layers through the dropdown menu.

Layer Borders

Borders can be displayed around layers by selecting one of the layers (1-10) in the dropdown box, ticking the Border check box and adjusting the settings as required.

Restrictions and Limitations

Setting a thickness of only a few pixels in size may not completely cover the edges of the layer. Increase the thickness until the edges are covered as expected.
A large radius may not completely cover the layer's border. Increase the thickness and/or reduce the radius until the corners are covered.
The Merge transition effect is not able to dynamically change the border in real time for performance reasons.
If the border of an input is different between the source and destination of a merge, or the cropping is different then it will be hidden for the duration of the transition.
The thickness of the border is impacted by the Zoom, so if Zoom is set to 0.5 (50%), the thickness will need to be double that of a 1 (100%) zoom to look the same size.
Layer Borders support standard aspect ratios only (Widescreen 16:9, Normal 4:3 or Anamorphic) sources with different aspect ratios such a square will result in the border becoming distorted or stretched on either axis.



Triggers



Triggers can be used to automate tasks when an Input either begins a transition (OnTransitionIn), begins a transition out (OnTransitionOut) or when a video completes playback (OnCompletion)
OnOverlayIn and OnOverlayOut can also be used when an Input is used as an Overlay
An unlimited number of tasks can be added, with each task running in the order it appears in the list.

In the example above the Title 1 input is turned on as an overlay 1 second after the current input begins a transition. After 5 seconds the overlay is turned off again.

Trigger
OnTransitionIn
OnTransitionOut
OnOverlayIn
OnOverlayOut
OnCompletion (applies to video, list, photos and powerpoint inputs when they reach the end assuming Loop is not enabled).
OnCountdownCompleted (applies to the title input, when a configured countdown clock reaches 0)

Function
Select a task or transition effect (such as Fade, Cut etc)
Note that in order to prevent loops, transition effects have no effect for OnTransitionIn or OnTransitionOut.

Input
Select the Input the Function applies to (if applicable)

Duration
Select the duration of the transition effect (if applicable)

Delay
This trigger will wait for the selected amount of time (in milliseconds) before completing the selected
Function and moving on to the next item in the list.

Triggers that use the same triggering name (such as OnTransitionIn) will run one after the other in the order that they are listed. In the example below, the OverlayInput1 function will be triggered 5 seconds after the ‘Input 1: Sample Video' has transitioned to the main screen, and then an additional 2 seconds after this, the OverlayInput2 function will be triggered.




Important Note: Duration is limited to 30 seconds maximum (30000 ms). Any duration higher than this will be limited to 30 seconds by vMix, to prevent triggers occurring later in a production unexpectedly.
Therefore, Triggers should not be used for long running operations, instead look at the PlayList or Scripting features.

Triggers and MultiView Overlays
Triggers will only be activated on the primary input. For example if Input A is setup with Input B and C as MultiView Overlays, only the Input A trigger will be used.
The exception to this is OnCountdownCompleted which will trigger regardless.


Tally Light

Automatically Mix Audio

Click the Green and Orange Arrow button to enable/disable automatic mixing of audio. This option is also known as "Follow" on traditional video switchers.

Audio Buses


vMix allows for up to eight independent audio buses (including Master) to allow for complex audio routing scenarios including mix minus.

M

M is the Master or Default audio mix and is sent to Recording, Streaming and External Output.


A, B, C, D, E, F, G

These are seven additional audio mixes that are sent to the respective Audio Output devices configured in the Audio Outputs settings window.

Click the M, A or B buttons underneath each input to configure each independent each mix. By default all new inputs will be sent to the Master mix only.
To enable or disable mixes C-G right click the A or B buttons to display a selection menu.

Sending Audio Bus to Master

Click the M button underneath buses A-G to include the audio in Master and Headphones.
Note: vMix Call Master/Headphones audio excludes any buses sent to master using this method as doing so would prevent mix minus from working correctly.

Note: The Speaker/Mute  button controls the audio for all audio buses not just the Master or M bus.

Collapsing Mixers
All mixers can be collapsed and restored by right clicking the Title of the mixer.


Audio Settings



General

Headphones Volume


Each audio input can have its own independent headphones volume set.
This is great for situations where you want an audio source such as a microphone audible on the final recording or stream but do not want to hear
it in your own headphones as the slight audio delay coming from your own microphone can be disorienting.

The headphones volume circle can be dragged up to move to the right (more volume) or dragged down to move to the left (less volume).
Or the headphones icon can be clicked to toggle between full volume (green) and muted (grey).

Pre / Post
These audio meters can be used to monitor the audio audio at the pre-effects stage (for any effects, volume or gain, including delay)
and the post-effects stage (after all effects, volume, gain and delay have been applied)

Format
Displays the current audio format of the input

Channel
Select the audio channel to use for this input.

If you have a Microphone plugged into the left channel or right channel independently. Select
SeparateMono here.
Separate mono allows you to adjust the volume of both mono channels independently from the Audio Mixer. The audio from each microphone will be audible on both the left and right channels simultaneously.

For finer control of how different channels are mixed. See Channel Mixer and Channel Matrix below.


Gain
Select the gain (or amplification) in decibels. Gain is added after the compressor. (See below)

Delay
Delay the audio source in milliseconds

Visible in Mixer
Untick this box to hide this Input from being displayed in the Audio Mixer.

Plugins

See Audio Plugins

EQ

Compressor
Compressor is a standard dynamic audio compressor.




Ratio: Specify a Ratio other than 1:1 to turn on the compressor.
Threshold: Specify the sound level for compression. Any audio above the threshold will be compressed (volume reduced) according to the ratio above.

Noise Gate

The Noise Gate is a handy way of reducing noise on an Audio Input such as a Microphone It works by quickly fading out the audio when it drops below a certain dB (decibel) Threshold



Channel Mixer

The channel mixer can be used to set the volume level of individual channels. An independent audio meter is also available for each channel.



Channel Matrix

Channel Matrix is an 16x16 audio router built in to every input.
This can be used for simple setups such as routing a mono Microphone channel to both Left and Right, all the way up to advanced scenarios
where each of the independent NDI or SDI Embedded audio channels can be routed to one of the eight stereo audio buses.

Each column represents a source channel, each row represents a destination bus that the channel can be routed to.


Example: Convert Mono Microphone on Channel 1 to Stereo
Click all the boxes so they are green like the following:




Example: Route 3 independent stereo audio language pairs to the 3 output buses.

The first two channels are routed to Master/Headphones L+R, the second two are routed to Bus A L+R and the final
two are routed to Bus B L + R.


Audio Plugins
The Audio Plugins feature allows adding 3rd party audio plugins to inputs and outputs in vMix. vMix supports all 64-bit VST3 audio plugins. VST3 is a popular audio plugin standard by Steinberg commonly used by DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) software.

Installing audio plugins
To install an audio plugin, simply install it to the computer using the provided installer from the plugin vendor. Once installed, it will appear automatically in vMix without any additional configuration required.

Adding an audio plugin to an Input or an Output Bus
Open the Audio Mixer in vMix by clicking the Audio Mixer tab in the middle right of vMix.

For Inputs: Locate the mixer for the audio input and click the cog icon to open up Audio Settings.
For Audio Buses: Locate the audio bus such as Master and click the cog icon to open up Audio Settings.

Click the Plugins tab as shown below:


Click the + button to add a new plugin.


Select the plugin to add from the Driver and Plugin dropdown boxes and click OK.
There are two boxes because some plugins may have multiple variations available within a single plugin set. In the above example the free "OldSkoolVerb" plugin has been selected, which is an audio reverb plugin.
Once added, the plugin will appear in the list. To configure the plugin's settings click Show Editor.



Temporarily turning on or off individual plugins
A checkbox next to each plugin in the list can be used to turn on or off that plugin.

Adjusting the plugin processing order
Plugins are applied to the audio in the order they appear in the list starting from top to bottom. The two arrow buttons at the right side of the list can be used to change the order.
Recording Audio
There are a number of ways to use audio in a vMix production. A couple of these approaches are described below including an advanced setup using an external audio mixer.

Basic - Use the built in vMIx Audio Mixer





In the diagram above, all audio sources such as Microphones and Cameras run directly into vMix.

vMix provides a built in fully functional professional audio mixer with built in EQ, Compression and Gain

controls.
More details can be found in the Audio Settings section.

The Master audio mix includes all inputs in vMix, including Cameras, Microphones and Videos and will be recorded according to the levels set in the built in Audio Mixer.
Make note of the Automatically Mix Audio setting as this determines if audio sources are automatically muted when not in use.

Multiple microphones can be connected to your vMix PC using a USB ASIO audio interface, such as from Behringer, M-Audio, Focusrite and others.
The Behringer UMC404 is an example of an audio interface that supports up to 4 XLR microphones and each can be added separately to the vMix audio mixer for independent control.


Advanced - Using an External Audio Mixer




In the diagram above, all external audio sources such as Microphones are connected to a separate external
Audio Mixer.

There are two connections that need to be made to vMix:

vMix Audio Output connected to External Audio Mixer Input

This contains all the audio from vMix inputs such as video clips.
This can be connected using a stereo audio cable from the computers built in Speaker Output or a USB Audio Interface such as the Behringer UMC404.
Many Audio Mixers include built in USB connectivity which is recommended to ensure the highest possible audio quality.

Regardless of which output method you choose, this output can be selected under the Master option
Settings -> Audio Outputs in vMix




External Audio Mixer Main Mix / Output connected to vMix

This is the final audio mix that should include all audio needed for the recording and stream.
This connection from the mixer to vMix can be made using a USB Audio Interface or the built in USB capabilities of some audio mixers (recommended)
Or using the Line In / Microphone input on the computer. If using the computers Line In, be sure to confirm the audio mixer output is "unbalanced".
As "balanced" audio signal will result in heavily muted and/or distorted audio. Finally, to add this audio mix to vMix, follow the instructions below:
Click Add Input in vMix and select Audio Input
Select the Audio Device and optionally the Channel(s) and click OK.


Open up the vMix Audio Mixer and turn off the "M" bus and enable bus "A" instead.


From Recording Setup, select BusA as the audio source and also from Streaming Settings -> Quality
as shown below:





A negative audio delay should also be used to compensate for the delay of routing all audio externally. This can be done from the Recording Setup window and also Settings -> External Output for the Stream

You may need to adjust this to suit your particular setup, but in general a delay of -80 for 30p and -100 for 25p works best.





Audio Meters
vMix displays Audio Meters in four different locations:


Main interface (next to transition buttons)
Next to each Input containing audio
Audio Mixer
Audio Settings

Each audio meter will display green levels when the audio is turned on and blue levels when muted.




The audio meters are also colour coded into 5 distinct bands to make it easy to determine the approximate audio level at a glance.



Levels are always displayed in dBFS (digital "full scale") where 0 dB equals the maximum possible volume for a given bit rate.

Peak Levels


So see the maximum peak levels of an audio source at any time, hover the mouse over the audio meters. The peak level displayed here is calculated as the maximum audio volume (amplitude) received in the past
~2 seconds.




Output Audio Channels
vMix supports eight independent stereo audio mixes or buses called Master (or M), A, B, C, D, E, F and G.

The output of this audio mixes can also be independently selected for the Recording, Stream and External Output as described below.

Enabling an Audio Bus/Mix
The Master mix is enabled at all times however, the A to G buses will only be enabled if a device is selected from the dropdown.

To enable the A to G buses, do one of the following in Settings -> Audio Outputs
Select Enabled from the dropdown box. or
Select from the dropdown a free device and channel on an audio device (such an ASIO audio interface)

Audio Mix Channel Options
Master: 2 Channel Master mix
BusA: 2 Channel A mix
BusB: 2 Channel B mix
MA: 2 Channel Master + 2 Channel A (4 channels)
MAB: 2 Channel Master + 2 Channel A + 2 Channel B (6 channels)
MABC: 2 Channel Master + 2 Channel A + 2 Channel B + 2 Channel C (8 channels)
MABCDEFG: 16 channels

Selecting the Audio Mix
Recording

Select the audio mix from the dropdown box next to Audio in Recording Setup

Select the Audio Bit Rate for the AAC audio stream in Kbps (Kilobits per second). A maximum of 192kbps can be selected. 128kbps is the default.

MPEG-2

Options are the same as above but with the following additional settings:

Bit Rate

Specify the Bit Rate for the MPEG-2 recording in Mbps (Megabits per second). 8 is recommended for SD, 25 for HD.

File Format

Specify either Program Stream (MPG) or Transport Stream (TS)
Transport Stream is recommended if the video will be edited by a program such as Sony Vegas.


WMV / WMV Streaming
NOTE: WMV Streaming is no longer officially supported.
HTTP Port (Streaming only)

Record
Click Record to start the video recording.


Note: The Cog Button must be clicked first to configure the recording prior to starting

A duration counter will begin next to the Start button as well as a dropped frame counter.

Dropped frames may indicate a computer performance issue, or merely as a side effect of using a different frame rate.
(For example of recording at 30fps from a 25fps source, 5 dropped frames will show up per second)


Second Recorder
A second recorder is available in the vMix 4K edition and higher.


To configure the second recording, select the 2 button at the top of the Recording Setup window and tick the Enabled checkbox to enable it.
This second recording has its own settings independent of the first recording including format, codec and the video and audio sources used.

This can provide a lot of flexibility, such as recording a second lower quality recording for internet publishing whilst retaining a higher quality
master for editing and archival.
However, the second recording cannot be independently controlled and will always start and stop at the same time as the primary recording.



Fault Tolerant Recordings
Some video formats hold some important information in memory until the recording is complete.
This means in the event of a power outage or system failure these recordings may be corrupt and difficult to recover.

TIP: Use the "New File Every" option to create new recordings at regular intervals so if one file is lost in event of a power outage, the majority of the recording can be recovered.

The following table describes the fault tolerance of each recording format supported by vMix:

Type

vMix Video Codec
The vMix Video Codec is a free recording format that provides high video quality with low CPU usage, suitable for use in post production video editing on Windows PCs.
The following is an overview of its features and capabilities:

Easy to use with no configuration settings required such as bitrate or quality.
Very low CPU usage requirements, allowing multiple channels of HD and 4K on a modern Intel i7 or i9 PC.
Records to the standard AVI video format which is compatible with most Windows video editors such as Adobe Premiere and Magix Vegas Pro.
Recordings are fault tolerant which means they can be recovered in the event of a power outage.
Supports SD, HD and 4K at all frame rates including interlaced broadcast formats.
Variable bitrate codec adapts to the content being recorded to provide an optimal balance between quality and practical file sizes for post production editing.

File Size Estimates
4K60: 700 - 900 Mbps (~350 GB per hour)
4K30: 350 - 450 Mbps (~175 GB per hour)

HD1080p60: 200 - 300 Mbps (~110 GB per hour)
HD1080p30: 100 - 150 Mbps (~55 GB per hour)

Editing recordings on other computers
vMix AVI files recorded using the vMix Video Codec can be edited on any Windows PC in most video editors including Adobe Premiere and Magix Vegas Pro.
Simply install a copy of vMix on any system used for editing. vMix does not need a license on these computers and does not need to be activated, but does need to be installed.

Converting vMix AVI files to ProRes MOV
vMix includes a program called vMix Media Converter that can transcode multiple vMix AVI files to ProRes MOV files.
This program can be located in the Windows Start Menu.

WAV File Record

The WAV File Record button in the Recording Setup can be toggled to turn on (green) or off recording a separate uncompressed (PCM) WAV file alongside the video recording.
It does not affect the audio in the recording itself. The audio format is fixed and can't be modified in vMix but can be converted into other audio formats such as MP3 once completed
using a 3rd party application. (not included with vMix).

Getting Started
The following is a quick overview of the steps needed to begin streaming to the web

Open the streaming window in vMix


Click the cog icon next to the Stream button in the main vMix window.

The streaming window will appear




Enter in your streaming provider details
Select your streaming provider from the drop down list or select Custom RTMP Server if your provider is not listed.
If your provider is listed, you can simply login and select a Channel to stream to directly from vMix as shown:


Alternatively, the channel settings can be specified manually using the instructions below.

Custom RTMP Server

vMix supports most 3rd party streaming providers (also known as CDNs) and dedicated streaming servers such as WOWZA.

The following information is needed from your chosen streaming provider:

URL For example rtmp://example.com/live

Stream Name or Key This may also be called Stream or Stream Name. Once you have retrieved this information, type it into the boxes provided.
Select a quality setting

The Quality setting you select will depend on a variety of factors, including the speed of your internet connection and your viewers.
The default setting of 360p 1.5mbps provides a low to medium quality stream that can be viewed by most broadband internet connections.

The cog icon can also be clicked to open up the Streaming Quality window where you can customise these settings to suit your requirements.

Select an Application
By default the free FFMPEG is installed with vMix and provides high quality streaming with H264 video and AAC audio.

Optionally, the free Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) can be installed in order to stream with vMix.
This can be downloaded from the Adobe web site.

FMLE can be used if your streaming provider does not support FFMPEG, or if you need MP3 audio encoding support.

Start Streaming!
Click Start All to begin streaming. The button will light up red in both the Streaming window and in the main vMix window when streaming.
After a few seconds if you receive an error, double check the settings in step 3. to ensure they match the details given to you by your streaming provider.

See Streaming Quality for more information

Application

FMLE
Use Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder as the streaming encoder. Requires Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder to be installed which is free from the Adobe web site.
FMLE has built in support for H264 video and MP3 audio. For AAC audio an additional plugin can be purchased from MainConcept.

FFMPEG
This is a free streaming encoder installed with vMix. FFMPEG supports H264 video and AAC audio.

FFMPEG provides better quality and AAC audio support, but may not be supported by some providers.

Use Hardware Encoder

This check box is available for most NVIDIA graphics cards and substantially reduces the CPU usage of the computer when streaming by taking advantage
of the hardware encoder built into most recent NVIDIA graphics cards, including the 750, 9xx and 10xx series.

NOTE: NVIDIA GeForce cards support a maximum of 2 simultaneous hardware encodes.
This means if you record to MP4 with Use Hardware Encoder ticked, than only one of your streams can also have the Use Hardware Encoder checkbox ticked as well.
Otherwise you will receive an error message when starting the second or third stream. The Quadro series cards do not have this restriction.

Start

Save all streaming settings and start the stream. This button will light up Red when running in addition to the Stream button in the main vMix window.

View Status

View some technical information on the stream while it is running. This is useful when troubleshooting connection issues.

Save and Close


Save all streaming settings and close the Streaming window.






Streaming Quality

The Streaming Quality window allows you to customise your streaming quality settings to suit your production.

Video Bit Rates
Set the video encoding bit rate in kbps.

Encode Size
Set the resolution of the stream here. These sizes should match the aspect ratio you are using in vMix. For example 640x360 for Widescreen and 640x480 for Normal (4:3)

Audio Bit Rate

Set the audio encoding bit rate in kbps. A minimum of 96 is supported for MP4 and a minimum of 64 is supported for AAC.
128 provides good near CD quality audio for both MP3 and AAC.

Video

Source
Select either Output 1 or Output 2 as the source for the stream in vMix 4K and Pro. In all other editions Output 1 will be used and this dropdown will not appear here.
To configure what is sent to Output 2, refer to the Settings - Outputs section.

Profile
Select the H264 encoding profile to use. Baseline is lower quality, but uses less CPU. Main is higher quality at the expense of higher CPU usage.

Level
This is an advanced setting for users wishing to specify a particular encoding level to match the capabilities of an end point decoder.

Preset
This is an advanced setting for users who wish to fine tune the FFMPEG encoder (x264)
veryfast is the recommended setting which provides the best balance of CPU usage and quality

Aspect Ratio / Crop
The stream can be cropped to a custom aspect ratio such as Square (1:1) and Vertical (9:16) to suite specialised streaming workflows.
The video is cropped to fit this aspect ratio by cutting the sides off the image.
To easily see the viewable area of the image from within the vMix production use Safe Areas to enable the Square or Vertical lines.

Keyframe Frequency
Select the number of seconds between each keyframe in the video stream. Higher numbers generally result in better video quality. 2 seconds is recommended
by some streaming providers and is the default here.

Threads
Specify the number of threads to use when encoding video and audio with FFMPEG as the Application. 4 is the default and is recommended. For 4K streaming, extra threads may provide better performance.

Network Buffer
This is the maximum number of seconds vMix can keep buffered at any time and reflects the maximum streaming latency
from vMix. (Note that streaming servers and players add their own buffers on to this time) Increase the Network Buffer if the maximum network speed available is unreliable.
Strict CBR

When this is enabled, vMix will try to keep the streaming speed as close to the selected bit rates as possible.
Note that this option may reduce the quality of the stream.

Keyframe Aligned
When sending multiple bitrates, select this option to ensure all streams are aligned on the same keyframe. This can improve seamless switching support at the expense of slightly lower quality.

Auto Adjust
When using FMLE as the encoder, the quality of the stream can be dynamically adjusted to suit the conditions of the internet connection.

Audio
Select the Audio encoding format to use with the stream.
MP3 is supported when using FMLE (Flash Media Live Encoder) as the encoder, while AAC is the only option when using FFMPEG.
If you would like to use FMLE with AAC, an additional plugin needs to be purchased from MainConcept.

Audio Channels
See Output Audio Channels
Multi Bitrate Support
vMix supports Multi Bitrate streaming with both the FMLE and FFMPEG streaming applications.

There are two methods of configuring Multi Bitrate depending on the requirements of your streaming provider. Please check with your streaming provider if you are unsure.

Single Stream Key
Select your streaming provider from the Destination dropdown box under stream 1.
Configure the first stream bitrate from Quality.
Configure up to two additional streams by selecting Stream 1 Multi-Bitrate as the Destination for stream 2 and optionally stream 3.




Untick Use Stream 1 Quality on each of these streams to configure an independent bitrate from the
Quality dropdown box.

Multiple Stream Keys
If your stream provider has given you a separate stream key for each stream, then configure these streams by selecting Custom Multi-Bitrate as the Destination dropdown and type in the separate URL and Stream Key for each stream.



Using Multiple Destinations
Up to three streaming destinations can be used by selecting the 1,2 and 3 buttons at the top of the Streaming Settings window.


NOTE: If you do not see these buttons, make sure Application has been set to FFMPEG.

Shortcuts can be assigned to almost any key on the keyboard.

Web Interface
All shortcuts are available from the built in web interface allowing you to use any web enabled device to control vMix. See Web for more information.

MIDI / X-Keys

Shortcuts can be assigned to buttons, faders and knobs on any MIDI compatible device.
keys controllers are also supported automatically by vMix and show up as MIDI commands as well.

Contour Design ShuttlePROv2
Shortcuts can be assigned to any button on the ShuttlePROv2.
The shuttle/jog wheel also works as a MIDI JogWheel which can be assigned to various shortcuts such as ReplayJumpFrames and ReplayChangeSpeed.

Elgato Stream Deck / Stream Deck Mini
Elgato Stream Deck devices can be used as a vMix controller.
Simply install the vMix Shortcuts plugin in the Stream Deck software from the Plugin Store. (version 4.0 or higher of the Stream Deck is required)
and then drag the Shortcut plugin on to the buttons you wish to use with vMix from within the Stream Deck software.

Once assigned to a button, create a shortcut within vMix as normal (See How to add a Shortcut). To locate the button on the controller, click the Find button in the Add Shortcut window.

If the shortcut Function relates to a particular input, the Display setting can be changed to Thumbnail to show a live video preview
of that input. The button display on the Stream Deck updates approximately 4 times a second.

How to add a Shortcut
From the vMix Settings window click the Shortcuts tab and then click Add




To quickly select the Key or Control you wish to assign this shortcut to, click the Find ... button and then press or move the control you wish to use.

MIDI Note: If using a MIDI controller, make sure it has been plugged in and turned on before starting vMix.
Then from the Shortcuts tab in Settings click the MIDI Settings button to enable the device.

Function
Click the arrow next to the Function dropdown box and the Select Function window appear with a number of commands or macros to choose from, organised by category.



Duration
If the function selected is a transition, configure the duration here in Milliseconds

Input
If the function controls a particular Input, select it here.
You can also tick Assign Shortcut to Input Number so this shortcut will always control any input assigned to a particular Number, otherwise the shortcut will control the same input even if it has been moved.

Title, Description1, Description2
Assign some optional text to uniquely identify your shortcut when it is displayed in the Web Controller

Display
Configure the display options when showing this shortcut in the Web Controller. Default: The standard button with text.
Colour: Customise the background colour of the standard button with text.
Image: Select a custom image file to display in place of the button. The image will be stretched to fit the button dimensions.
Thumbnail: Display a thumbnail preview of the Input's contents at the time when the Web Controller page was last refreshed.
(Note: This is not a live thumbnail preview, but the latest image can be downloaded by refreshing the page in the web browser).

Local Shortcut (This Preset Only)


Assigns the shortcut to the currently open Preset, otherwise the shortcut will be available to use with any preset.

See Local and Global Shortcuts for more information.

Show in Web Controller
Untick this box to hide this shortcut from the vMix Web Controller interface.


Templates
The Shortcut Templates feature allows you to import and export sets of shortcut keys and save graphical layouts for reference and printing purposes.

How to load a shortcut template
Click the template from the right hand list so it is highlighted green.
If you don't see your template in the list, click Import to locate the file and add it to the list.

Click the Apply button. This will override any existing Shortcuts that share any of the buttons.


A number of templates are provided built-in:

AudioLaunchControlXL
This template is designed to be used with the novation LaunchControlXL USB MIDI controller.
It assigns the first 7 faders to the first 7 inputs in vMix and the final fader is assigned as the Master volume control.

Default Keyboard

This template contains the default keyboard shortcuts that were included with previous versions of vMix.

Replay ShuttlePROv2
This template assigns common Instant Replay functions to the ShuttlePROv2 USB controller


Local and Global Shortcuts
vMix supports two types of Shortcuts: Local and Global.

Global shortcuts are saved in the vMix settings and will be remembered each time vMix is opened. Local shortcuts are saved in Presets and will only be remembered if a Preset is saved and subsequently opened later.

Local shortcuts take preference over Global shortcuts, so if you have two shortcuts assigned to the letter A, one local and one global, the local shortcut will be triggered and the global shortcut will be ignored.
Assigning Multiple Functions to a single Shortcut
Multiple functions can be easily assigned to as single keyboard or controller button press. To do this, simply add multiple shortcuts, assigning them to the same button.

When the button is pressed they will be called in the order in which they appear in the Shortcuts list. Use the up and down buttons to change the order if necessary.

Advanced MIDI Shortcuts
For most MIDI and X-Keys controllers with buttons and faders, simply following the steps in How to add a Shortcut is all that is needed.

However, some controllers may have controls that operate a bit differently to what vMix expects, which is why
there are a couple of extra MIDI control options available in the Edit Shortcut window as shown below.



Channel, Note
Channel and Note are automatically detected by clicking Find and pressing the MIDI button or moving the fader or knob.

Value
If you would like to assign different shortcuts to different positions of a single control, such as a rotary knob, you can tick
the Value box and specify a number between 0 and 127.

Type
For most controls that provide a linear value from 0-127 the Default setting is recommended here.

Other controls, known as Jog Wheels are continuous and only send a value for left and a value for right, and some may even provide different values depending on how fast the wheel is turned.

For these controls, set the Type to one of the JogWheel settings.
There are four speeds of JogWheel available in vMix so that the jog wheel either controls the corresponding Function in slow (JogWheel and JogWheel2X) or fast (JogWheel5X and JogWheel10X)
increments.

For example, setting the Type to JogWheel and setting the Function to SetMasterVolume will increase the volume when turning the control right and lower the volume when turning the control left.

For instant replay, JogWheel MIDI controls can be assigned to the ReplayJumpFrames function to move backwards/forwards through a replay frame by frame
or ReplayChangeSpeed to slow down playback when moving the control left, and speed up again when moving the control right.

NOTE: Both the Shuttle and Jog Wheel controls on X-Keys controllers should be configured as JogWheel here.
Dynamic Input and Value Shortcuts
Dynamic shortcuts allow changing the Value or Input a shortcut uses with the press of a button. This can be used to reduce the number of buttons needed to be setup in complex productions.

For example, consider a controller where one button is for Mute, and one for Solo.
Normally these would only control a single input. With dynamic inputs you can have a row of buttons to select what these buttons control live.

Dynamic Inputs
When selecting an Input for a shortcut (for example "Fade"), scroll up the Input dropdown box to select

either Dynamic1, Dynamic2, Dynamic3 or Dynamic4.
By default these are set to nothing, so the shortcut will have no effect when pressed.

To choose what input this shortcut will Fade, create another shortcut on a separate button and set the Function to SetDynamicInput1, SetDynamicInput2, SetDynamicInput3 or SetDynamicInput4 (matching the number you used in Step 1)

Set the Value of this shortcut to a Number or Name of the input you wish to assign.

Press this button to assign the input to Dynamic1. Now when you press the Fade shortcut it will fade to that input as expected.

With this style of shortcuts you can assign a row of buttons to select various inputs into Dynamic1, then have other inputs (such as transition buttons) that will transition to that input.
The order of pressing buttons is important, you press the shortcut to assign the input first, then press the shortcut you wish to run on that input second.

Dynamic Values
Dynamic Values are similar to Dynamic Inputs above expect they can be used to change the Value a Shortcut uses.

Add a shortcut that requires a Value (for example "SetText") and type in Dynamic1, Dynamic2, Dynamic3 or Dynamic4 as the Value.
If using SetText be sure to select the Title input to use and also the Title dropdown to select the field. By default this shortcut will have no effect when pressed as Dynamic1 has not yet been set to anything.

Create another shortcut on a separate button and set the Function to SetDynamicValue1, SetDynamicValue2, SetDynamicValue3 or SetDynamicValue4

Set the Value to the text you wish to use, for example "Hello!".

Press the second shortcut and then press the first, the text selected by the second shortcut will appear in the title assigned to the first.

Activators
Activators are supported for Dynamic Inputs. If an activator is assigned to Input 5 and Event InputDynamic1 then that button will light up
when Input 5 has been selected into Dynamic1.

Examples
Transitions
A row of input buttons and another row of transition effects. Press the input button then press the transition effect button to complete the action.
Audio
A row of input buttons and another row of audio control buttons (Mute, Solo, Bus selection etc)
Replay
A row of tag names and a separate button for each camera to assign the tags to replay events

Activators - MIDI Lights and Faders

Activators can be used to activate lights, button LEDs and motorised faders in response to changes in vMix. For example, you can assign a row of LED buttons on MIDI controller to a row of Inputs in vMix and have them each light up when the corresponding input is live.
Activators supports most MIDI and X-Keys controllers. Getting Started
Add/Edit Activator
Activator Examples


Getting Started
Go to vMix Settings and click the Activators tab


By default no devices (i.e MIDI or X-Keys controllers) are enabled, so to select the controller you wish to use click Enable Devices.

For help on all the settings available when adding an Activator see Add/Edit Activator

Add/Edit Activator


Control
Select and configure the type of control. For X-Keys controllers this will also be "Note". For MIDI controllers this is usually Note for buttons and ControlChange for things like knobs and faders.
This is also where the Channel and Note need to be selected that correspond with the button, light or fader you wish to setup.
To make things easier you can click Find and press the button or control to locate the correct settings.

Event
This is the change in vMix that you want to turn on a button light, or move a motorised fader. There are a number of events to choose from as described below:

Default
Default is handy for configuring a default color for buttons that support multiple colors when the button state is "off".
For example you may want a row of buttons to be orange when none are selected here. When using this option you can also type in a range of notes up the top.
Input
This will turn on when the selected input is currently live and in the vMix Output.

InputPreview
This will turn on when the selected input is currently in Preview

InputPlaying
This will turn on when the selected Input is playing.

InputVolume, InputHeadphones, MasterVolume, MasterHeadphones, BusAVolume, BusBVolume
This will assign a MIDI value from 0 to 127 when the volume of an Input, Headphones or Master volume changes.
This can be used with motorised faders or rotary controls with LED indicators InputAudio, InputSolo, InputBusAAudio, InputBusBAudio, InputMasterAudio This will turn on when the selected input's audio/solo/bus etc button is turned on. MasterAudio, BusAAudio, BusBAudio
This will turn on when the Master or Bus audio button is turned on.

FadeToBlack
This will turn on when the FTB button in vMix is turned on.

Recording, Streaming, External, Fullscreen
This will turn on when the Recording, Streaming, External or Fullscreen output are turned on.

Input
Select the input you wish to use with the selected event.

Tick the "Assign Activator to Input Number" box if you want this activator assigned to a particular input position only, so if inputs are moved around in vMix, the activator will not move.

Type
Select the type of button, fader or other type of MIDI control here.
There are a number of options available, depending on the model of MIDI controller.
This is also where the button color is selected if the MIDI controller supports different colors, such as the AKAI APC40

Local (this preset only)
Tick this box to have this Activator saved only within the current preset.

vMix Control Surface

NOTE: The Control Surface is no longer available. This documentation is for reference by existing users only.



vMix Control Surface is an optional hardware control surface for vMix that connects via USB. The following is a User Guide that describes the capabilities of each of the buttons and controls.

Setting Up
Visit http://www.vmix.com/controlsurfacedownload/ to download the latest drivers.
Run the installer and accept the prompts to install. Once installed, verify you have the latest version of vMix. vMix Control Surface is compatible with all installations of vMix version 15 and beyond.

Plug in USB cable from vMix Control Surface to Computer. The lights should flash briefly indicating the unit is receiving power over the USB connection. When using the Control Surface, it must be plugged in prior to opening vMix in order to be recognized. If you plug the unit in while vMix is running, you may need to restart vMix to recognize the Control Surface is connected.


The Control Surface uses an industry standard cross point layout consisting of Preview, Program and Overlay keys.
Each input in vMix has a number next to the input name. These correspond to numbers on the Overlay, Program and Preview rows on the Control Surface.
The Control Surface provides access to the first 12 inputs. Inputs can be dragged and dropped in vMix to

position the most frequently used sources for use by the control surface.

Preview Bus (Bottom Row)
Press the number of the input on the Preview row that you want to assign to Preview.



Program Bus (Middle Row)
Press the number of the input on the Program row that you want to assign to the Program or Output. This will cut or take the input directly to output without any transitions.

Overlay Bus (Top Row)
In vMix, graphics placed on top of other sources are known as Overlays. These are also known as Down Stream Keyers (DSK) because the graphics are usually “keyed” over live video after any upstream effects are applied. The DSK buttons on the Control Surface correspond to the 1 through 4 numbers underneath each input in vMix (see graphic on page 1).

Select the Overlay channel you wish to use. Example: if you want to overlay an input on channel 1, press the DSK1 button. It will now light up indicating overlay channel one on the first 12 inputs is ready to be used.
Press the desired input you wish to overlay. Example: if you have a lower third title in input 6, press button 6 on the Overlay row. Button 6 will then light up indicating that input 6 is overlaid on channel 1 of the chosen input.
To see which inputs are currently active on each overlay channel, you can cycle through the 4 DSK buttons. If an overlay channel has an active input, the corresponding input will light up.


Function Buttons (F1, F2, F3)

To program the Function buttons, open up the settings window in vMix and click the Shortcuts tab.
Click Add and a new window opens, with drop down menus showing usable keys and available vMix shortcuts.
Click the Key drop down and scroll down to SurfaceF1, SurfaceF2, SurfaceF3. These correspond to the F1, F2 and F3 keys on the Control Surface.
Select the desired Function. Example: if you wanted a button to start recording, select Start Recording.
Press Ok and the selected function button is now ready to be used.

ALT Button
The ALT button can be held down in conjunction with other buttons in order to change their functionality. This will allow enhancements to be added to future updates of vMix.

It presently operates as follows:

Hold down ALT while pressing a Preview row button to start playing that input if it is a video clip.
Hold down ALT while pressing one of the Overlay row buttons to turn on that overlay in the Preview window instead of directly to Program/Output.
During the next transition the previewed Overlay will automatically be activated over the top of Program/ Output.


Transition Buttons

In live switching, changing from one camera or clip to another is called a transition. The vMix Control Surface has three available transition types available, corresponding to transition buttons in vMix.
For a hard cut between two inputs, press the “Take” button
To use a stylized transition such as a wipe, fade or zoom, there are customizable transitions located at the top of the vMix interface. “Auto 1” and “Auto 2” correspond to the first two transitions below Cut. When these transition types are changed in the vMix window, the transition will also change for the buttons.
Press “FTB” to fade the live output to a black screen. (Fade To Black)

T-Bar Operation
By default, the T-Bar allows a manual fade transition between Preview and Program.
The transition effect is linked with the Auto 1 and the first transition button in the vMix interface. If this button is changed from Fade to Wipe for example the T-Bar movement will create a wipe transition instead of a fade.

Web Controller

vMix Web Controller allows any web capable device to remotely control Shortcuts, Switching and Titles. It can also be used to turn any mobile phone into a wireless tally light.

Examples of web capable devices include tablets, iPads and mobile phones.

The vMix Web Controller is turned on by default and you can find the web site address to type in our device by clicking
Settings in the main vMix window and then clicking the Web Controller tab.



After typing in the Web Site Address into your device's browser, the following page will be displayed:


There are four buttons available:

Camera Requirements
Instant Replay primarily works with cameras connected to a capture card.
This includes HDMI and SDI cameras connected to a capture card either via PCI Express, Thunderbolt or USB 3.0.
NDI sources can also be used with Instant Replay as long as they are in the same format as the current Replay Session.

Webcams, IP cameras, and other types of video sources are not directly supported.

To use these types of inputs, the "Output" camera option can be selected in the Instant Replay settings. Output will capture everything that is currently playing to the output in vMix.

Camera Resolution / Frame Rate
All cameras must have the same resolution.
Different frame rates are permitted as long as all cameras are sending Progressive or PsF video.
Frame rates will be converted by either duplicating or deleting frames to match the Replay Session frame rate.

High Frame Rate Requirements
High frame rates such as 120FPS or higher require specialised cameras and capture cards.
In particular the camera must support outputting at 120FPS or higher, as many cameras have recording support for high frame rates but do not actually output at this rate via the HDMI or SDI output.

CPU requirements also change for high frame rate sources, as a general rule 1x 120FPS is the equivalent of 2x 60FPS sources.

vMix Requirements
Note: Instant Replay and MultiCorder cannot be used at the same time.


Workflow changes since version 23
vMix Replay has undergone some significant workflow changes in version 24 which are outlined below for reference.

New Replay Session and Recording Format
To facilitate higher camera and 4K formats, vMix Replay now uses the vMix AVI format for its recordings

instead of the previous MPEG-2 MPG files.
As a result, a new replay session folder will need to be created.
Existing replay session folders can be opened and viewed in 24, but should no longer be used for new productions.

vMix AVI files can be imported into Adobe Premiere, Magix Vegas Pro directly, or the Export Clips feature can be used to export in MP4 format.
vMIx AVI cannot be uploaded directly to sites such as YouTube, Twitter etc, so exporting in MP4 will be required to use these platforms.

vMix AVI files also have a slightly higher bitrate as they are higher quality at 4:2:2 vs the previous format's 4:2:0 format, so recording remaining times
may be reduced by up to 20%.

Independent Output Channels
In previous releases, A and B outputs were fixed to the same time for both.
In 24, these are still linked by default, but can now be used completely independently if required. Events can be played back in A while events are edited in B and vice versa.
Shortcuts also allow assigning tasks to a particular channel as needed.

Event Transition Overlapping
In previous releases, a transition effect between events would occur after the out point of the previous event and before the in point of the next, leading to playing back extra video at the end and start of the two events.

In 24, this has been changed so the transition effect will overlap the end and start of the two events. Operators will need to consider expanding the in and out times of events if they wish to emulate the previous behaviour.

ShuttlePro v2 Controller Changes
ShuttlePro v2 Jog/Shuttle controls in previous releases were fixed and could not be changed. In 24, the ShuttlePro v2 now works as a fully customisable replay controller.
As a result shortcuts need to be added to replicate the previous jog/shuttle behaviour.
The buttons have also changed from ReplayA, ReplayB functions to standard MIDI numbers.

The new built in ShuttlePro v2 replay template in Shortcuts has been updated to emulate all the previous behaviour
and will need to be imported into shortcuts for all users that used this controller in version 23 and prior.

Event Cut/Copy/Paste
Events can now be copied and pasted using a cut/copy/paste workflow.
The previous workflow of copying and moving via menu numbers is still available if preferred.

Per-Event Speeds
Each event can now have independent speeds assigned on playback, or left as default. See Creating and Editing events for the specific playback behaviour of this feature.




Getting Started

To begin using vMix Replay, first add all of the cameras you will be using to vMix as inputs. Next, click Add Input and select the Instant Replay tab as shown below:
Important: Click here to see the Instant Replay system requirements.


Session Folder
This is the location where all Instant Replay recordings will be saved. This must be dedicated SSD based storage

After selecting a folder, vMix will display an estimated recording time based on the selected recording format and bit rate.

Recording Format
The recording format must match all camera sources that will be used.

Delete All
This button will delete all video, audio and events within the selected session folder while keeping all replay settings intact, including music and tags.
This allows you to use the same session folder and configuration for each game.

Automatically delete prior video when disk space is low
vMix Replay automatically splits each camera recording every 20 minutes.
If disk space is running low, vMix Replay can automatically delete the earliest 20 minutes of the recording to continue.
Note that any events that occurred in this deleted video will be lost.

If this option is left unticked, vMix Replay will automatically stop recording and notify the user that the disk space is low.

Cameras


Select any Camera input already added to vMix here, if you add an input later on you can revisit this configuration window by clicking the cog icon in the Instant Replay Controller window.
Output is also supported as one of the camera inputs, and will record all video and audio playing in the vMix output just like a standard recording.

Playback Audio Source
This is the audio source vMix will use when playing back events.
Master can be selected which represents the master audio mix at the time the event being played back occurred.
Follow can be used to automatically switch the audio to the embedded audio of the active camera angle.

Master Audio Channels
Selects the audio channels to record from the Master audio mix.
By default this is the standard stereo master audio but can also be an audio bus or a combination of two buses (for 4 channels total)

In Transition
Select the transition to use when playing back events. This can be a standard transition, or optionally any stinger that has already been configured.

Out Transition
Select the transition to use once the event playback has completed.

Event Transition
Select the transition to use between each event when more than one event is selected for playback, such as in a highlight reel.

Match Replay Speed
When ticked, any transitions between events will be slowed down to match the current replay speed. (For example a 200ms transition will become 400ms when the replay speed is 50%)

Workflow Overview
Once a new Instant Replay session has been configured and added to vMix (See Getting Started) two new Inputs will appear. Replay A and Replay B.


These are two playback channels that can be used to play previously recorded footage at any time.

Each can have a camera angle assigned from any of the recorded cameras and these can be switched live.

Basic Replay Example
Consider a basketball game where the live Camera 1 is currently selected into the vMix output.
Make sure vMix Replay is recording by clicking the record button  so it lights up red.

When a team scores a goal, click the -5 button  to instantly create a replay.
When you are ready to play back that goal, click the automatic replay button  .

This will transition input A to output, play the event then transition back to Camera 1 when completed. While the event is playing, try moving the scroll wheel on your mouse to change the playback speed.

Advanced Replay
The example above allows you create quick replays of a single camera with only a single click.
But what if you want to playback one or more previous events or change camera angles and add notes? The Main Interface can be displayed by clicking the vMix Replay tab
 located next to the Audio Mixer tab. on the bottom right hand side of the main vMix window.

See User Interface Overview for the controls available.




Live and Recorded modes
Events are created in two modes based on the color of the Live button in the Instant Replay Controller

Live Mode (RED)



When in Live Mode, all new events are created are based on the current time "as it happens" on the live cameras.

Starting a recording will turn on Live Mode automatically.

Recorded Mode


When in Recorded Mode, all new events are created based on the time displayed above the position bar in the Instant Replay controller.




This allows the operator to move the position bar back and forth through previous video to create events that may have been missed live.

TIP: Be sure to enable Live Mode again when finished if you are in the middle of a recording

Creating and Editing events
In vMix Replay, events represent short clips of time for one or more camera angles.
As vMix Replay records continuously, these events can be edited, changed and deleted at any time without losing any footage.

Use the Mark In/Out buttons, shortcuts or controller buttons to create new events as required. See the Live and Recorded modes overview to find out which times are used when creating events.

Within the user interface, each event has the following columns:

ID
A 3 or 4 digit number (customisable in replay settings) that unequally identifies each event. This number is fixed when created and cannot be manually changed.
When copying an event, the copy will have a new number assigned.

In
The start time of the event.

Out
The finish time of the event.

Duration
The time between In and Out

Speed
When -- this means it will play the event at whatever the previous event speed is. If no events specify a speed, this will be the speed the controller is currently set to.
When set to a specific speed, the event will play at that speed, and that speed will become the new default speed for any subsequent events with no speed set.

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
These columns represent the up to 8 camera angles available. Checking each box enables playback of that angle when playing the event.
Right click the text boxes next to the check boxes to input text to help identify each event and angle.






User Interface Overview
vMix Replay includes a centralised Instant Replay Controller that can either be docked to the main vMix window or opened separately.

Main Interface


Mini Interface

The mini interface is located next to the Instant Replay channel "A" input and includes common controls such as recording, quick 5 second or 10 second mark in / out buttons,
a playback last event button and a settings button.

Slow motion can also be controlled here in addition to the main interface.

PTZ - Pan Tilt Zoom

PTZ Control is an advanced feature found in the 4K and Pro editions of vMix.

vMix supports controlling multiple Pan Tilt and Zoom cameras directly from the main interface and by shortcut and/or joystick control.
PTZ support can be enabled on any input, providing the ability to enable PTZ support regardless of how the camera is connected, be it SDI, HDMI, NDI
or RTSP Stream.

NOTE: PTZ cameras will need to be connected to the same network as vMix in order to be controlled.
This is usually done over Ethernet and is a separate cable connection if the video is coming in via SDI or HDMI through a Capture Card.

Enabling PTZ Control
To enable PTZ support on a particular camera, go to the Input Settings of that camera and select the PTZ tab as show below.


Selecting the PTZ camera Device Type
Select the device type that matches your camera from the Device Type dropdown box. vMix currently supports the following types of PTZ cameras:

Virtual PTZ
Turns any input into a virtual Pan Tilt and Zoom controller. Select from the dropdown box the desired digital zoom level.

PTZ Cameras
An up to date list of supported PTZ cameras can be found at the link below: https://www.vmix.com/software/supported-hardware.aspx#ptz-cameras

It is important to note that for simplicity and ease of use, only PTZ cameras that support network control are supported.
Cameras that only have serial control such as via the VISCA or Pelco RS-422 or RS-232 protocols are not currently supported.

Entering in the PTZ camera network address
Once the Device Type is selected, a box to enter either a Web Address or IP Address will be displayed. This is the IP address configured for the camera as per the camera's network documentation.
For more information on how to configure and locate this IP address, refer to the cameras documentation.


Connecting to the PTZ camera
Once the Device Type and Address have been selected click Connect to connect to the camera. If successful, the controls below the Connect button will be enabled.

Controlling a PTZ Camera

vMix provides three different methods for controlling a PTZ camera, you can either pick the method that suits your production or use a combination of all three!

PTZ control using Virtual Inputs

This method allows assigning a PTZ position to its own Input in vMix, turning one camera into potentially unlimited "Virtual" cameras!

PTZ control using the mouse

Simple push button controls for up, down, left, right etc to move the camera into position

PTZ control using shortcuts and joysticks

Assign shortcut keys or controls to PTZ movements, including the ability to assign the joysticks on an XBOX controller to a PTZ camera.







PTZ control using Virtual Inputs
Perhaps the easiest way to control PTZ cameras is to create a number of "Virtual Inputs" for a particular PTZ camera and assign a particular pan, tilt and zoom position when selected.

In vMix, this is relatively straightforward to setup:

Step 1 - Enable PTZ Control
Follow the instructions under PTZ - Pan Tilt Zoom to enable PTZ control for a particular Camera input.

Step 2 - Move the camera into position
Use the provided controls under the Input Settings PTZ tab to move the camera into the position you wish to create a virtual input for.

Step 3 - Click Create Input at this Position



This will create a new input based on the current camera and PTZ position.


You can see these two inputs side by side in the screenshot above.

TIP: You can also right click the cog icon underneath the PTZ camera to create PTZ Virtual Inputs without going into Input Settings


Step 4 - Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create as many virtual inputs as needed
Step 5 - Use these inputs just as you would if multiple real cameras were available
Any time one of these inputs is selected into Preview, the PTZ camera will automatically move into position. When the input is not visible in either Preview or Output, a static image of what the camera was seeing when the input was created will be displayed to make it easy to locate a particular camera angle.

PTZ enables the operator to create the illusion of a large multi camera production with just 2 PTZ cameras!
The basic work flow involves swapping between the two cameras, paying careful attention to make sure the

movement of a camera is complete in Preview before switching it to Output.

Updating PTZ Virtual Inputs

Each virtual input that is created will create a corresponding update button in the Input Settings PTZ tab.




The number next to each button (for example "Update Input 2") corresponds to the number of the input in the main window.
Moving the camera and then clicking the corresponding update button will update that virtual input so that it recalls that position in the future.

TIP: You can also right click the cog icon underneath the PTZ camera to update any of the PTZ Virtual Inputs without going into Input Settings

Automation using shortcuts

Most of the buttons available for PTZ are also available a shortcuts.
See the PTZ section of Shortcut Function Reference for more information.

PTZ control using the mouse
PTZ cameras can be controlled using the buttons provided in the PTZ tab under Input Settings. The options available are described in the following diagram.





PTZ control using shortcuts and joysticks
PTZ cameras can be controlled by assigning a PTZ shortcut to an input where PTZ has been configured. For example the shortcut "PTZMoveUp" once activated will keep the camera moving upward until a corresponding "PTZMoveStop" shortcut is activated.

For more information on the shortcuts available see Shortcut Function Reference

PTZ Control using an XBOX compatible controller
vMix includes a shortcut template that assigns PTZ control to joysticks and buttons on a USB XBOX controller


By default this template assigns all the buttons to the Preview input which means as long as a PTZ enabled camera is in input it can be moved and controlled using this template.

Of course, the shortcuts in this template can be edited to assign to a particular input if you prefer.

PTZ Shortcuts and Speed Control
By default, PTZ shortcuts will use the speeds defined by the sliders in the Input Settings PTZ tab.
To specify a custom speed, specify a fractional number between 0 and 1 as the Value of the shortcut.

Variable Speed Control / Pressure Sensitive Control
To enable variable speeds on pressure sensitive controllers (such as joysticks and the XBOX controller), from shortcuts tick the Pressure Enabled checkbox
for all applicable shortcuts.

NDI - Network Device Interface



NDI is an easy way to send and receive high quality, low latency video and audio between supported devices using a standard Gigabit enabled network.
For example you can produce one aspect of your show on one computer and send the output to vMix running on another.

vMix supports both sending and receiving NDI.

Receiving NDI Sources
See NDI / Desktop Capture for more information.

Sending video and audio from vMix using NDI
vMix supports sending a number of different types of output via NDI.
To enable a particular type of output for NDI, it must first be turned on from Settings - Outputs / NDI

Output 1
This is the main Output (or "Program") feed and includes the Master stereo audio mix

Output 2, 3, 4
These are independent outputs that can be configured to show Output, Preview, MultiView or a particular input.
See Settings - Outputs / NDI for more information.

Cameras / Calls / Audio Inputs
Any Camera, Video Call or Audio inputs currently being used in vMix can also be viewed remotely via NDI.

Audio Outputs
Master, Headphones, A and B mixes in vMix can all be independently accessed over the network using NDI. The A and B mixes can be enabled by assigning them to Enabled in the dropdown list in Settings - Audio Outputs
and also by checking the Audio Output box in the NDI section under Settings - Outputs / NDI

Changing additional settings such as audio channel on an Output
Output 1,2,3 and 4 each have a cog button that provides access to additional options when using these outputs with NDI, SRT, MultiCorder or with Instant Replay.
(Note; vMix Call has a separate option to select an audio track for a caller, so in this case, changing the audio source here will have no effect).

The two options currently available allow sending a particular audio bus, or enabling alpha channel support.

Alpha Channel Support
Alpha Channel Support for NDI Sources
vMix automatically supports alpha channel when it is detected on an NDI source.
If the source provides the video as "pre-multiplied alpha", be sure to turn on the checkbox in the Colour Adjust tab in Input Settings

Alpha Channel Support for NDI Output
When using the Output options with NDI, these will by default send standard "YUV" video without alpha channel.
To enable Alpha Channel on output follow the steps below:

Open vMix Settings and go to the Outputs / NDI tab
Click the cog icon next to the Output you wish to enable Alpha Channel for.
Under the Alpha Channel setting, select Straight or Premultiplied depending on the receiving application requirements.

SRT - Secure Reliable Transport

Secure Reliable Transport is an open source video transport protocol. It optimises streaming performance across unpredictable networks, such as the Internet, by dynamically adapting to the real-time network conditions.

Features
Input and Output (send and receive) support for Caller, Listener and Rendezvous connection methods.
256 bit encryption through use of PassPhrase.
Hardware (GPU) accelerated encoding and decoding of HEVC or H264 video in up to 4K (where supported by the underlying hardware and operating system).
Up to 8 channels of AAC audio.

Technical/System Requirements
Windows 10 x64 or higher
Graphics card with support for HEVC and H264 encoding and decoding. NVIDIA Quadro P2000 or higher series recommended.
NOTE: NVIDIA GeForce 9xx series or lower should not be used with SRT, and is unsupported.
When using HEVC on Windows 10, the "HEVC Video Extensions" from the Microsoft Store is required to be installed.
Progressive video formats are supported only. (interlaced support is not available)
vMix supports HEVC or H264 video and AAC audio (AAC-LC) wrapped in a transport stream only. Other codecs are not supported.

Setting up an input stream
See SRT Input for more information.

Setting up an output stream
From the vMix Settings, go to the Outputs tab and click the cog icon next to the output channel you wish to send.
The following settings will appear:



Enable SRT
Check this box to enable the SRT output.

Type
Listener: Listen on the specified Port on all network adapters on the computer for connections. Hostname is ignored.
Caller: Connect to the specified Hostname and Port.
Rendezvous: Connect to the specified Hostname and Port. The other side must also be set to Rendezvous with an identical port number specified.
This mode allows connecting through most firewalls automatically.

Latency
Specify the latency of the connection in milliseconds to adapt to network congestion. The higher this value, the better SRT can handle difficult network conditions.
As a general rule this should be set to at least 4x the ping time destination IP. So 20ms would require a latency setting of at least 80
This must be set to the same value on both ends.

Passphrase
Specify a password to encrypt the connection. This password must be used by both sides for the connection to be established.

Key Length
This is the encryption strength to use. Multiple by 8 to convert to bits, for example 32 = 256bit encryption.


Stream ID
Optional Stream ID that may be required by your streaming provider to uniquely identify the stream.

Quality
Select one of the built in compression profiles from the list or click the cog icon to customise the encoding settings.


Video Codec
Select either H264 or HEVC as the video compression method.

Video Bandwidth / Audio Bandwidth
Specify the bandwidth in bits per second for Video and Audio. Example 2000000 = 2mbps and 128000 = 128kbps.
Audio bandwidth is total for all channels. For example for 8 channels, 384 = 48 kbps per channel.

Use Hardware Encoder
Use accelerated encoding where available on the graphics card. NVIDIA GeForce cards (and some low end Quadro cards) are limited to 2 simultaneous encodes per system.
This includes the Streaming and Recording features in vMix, so care should be taken to ensure this tick box is only enabled at two locations when using these types of cards.
(such as 1x Stream and 1x SRT)

Use Low Power Encoder
Some Intel Graphics drivers included support for "VDENC" which is a low power, high performance encoder built in to some CPUs.
Tick this box to enable using this encoder where available.

Audio Channels
Specify the audio source for this output. A maximum of 8 channels of audio is supported by AAC.

Resolution
Optionally specify a resolution to downscale to. Only progressive formats are supported.

Alpha Channel
This setting must be set to None as alpha is not supported by the video codecs used by SRT.

Data Sources

Data Sources in vMix can be used to assign dynamic text and images to Titles from a variety of sources including Google Sheets, Excel, CSV, XML and Text.
These sources can be from files on the local system, network or internet and data will update the title automatically as it changes.

For example, you can create a Spreadsheet with a list of speakers and have somebody update the data from a different computer on the same network
or even from the other side of the world!

Types of Data Sources Setting up a new Data Source
Mapping a Data Source to a Title Controlling Data Sources
Using Images in Data Sources


Types of Data Sources
Excel/CSV
This data source supports XLSX, XLS, ODS, CSV, HTML, PDF and XPS tables. Multiple tables can be utilised from a single file simultaneously.

If the first row of each table contains the names of each column, tick the "Use first row as column names" tick box in the Settings window.

Google Sheets
This data source supports Google Sheets that have been shared to be viewed by anyone. From within Google Docs, click the Share button in the top right hand corner.


Then click Get shareable link


Finally copy the link provided into the URL box in the vMix Data Source Settings.






Google Sheets also requires an API Key which can be created by following the instructions below.
How to create a Google API Key

RSS
Use any web site address in RSS format with this data source. RSS is commonly used by news sites, blogs and other online information sites.

Text
Select any text file to use as a data source, for example Stream Labels on Twitch Alerts.

XML
Select any XML compliant web site or file to use as a data source.
To select which XML element to use as a data source, the XPath setting will need to be filled in.

For more information on the XPath format, refer to the Wikipedia page below: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath

JSON
This supports JSON data that is stored as an object array. Each element in the array will be treated as a row.



Setting up a new Data Source
Open up the Data Sources Manager from the  menu in the bottom right hand corner of the main vMix window.




The following window will appear. click the  button to add the first Data Source


Once added, a window will appear where you can type either the web address to the data file or browse for it on the local computer.
Depending on the Data Source type, a number of other settings may appear in this window.




Name: Provide a memorable name to identify this data source.
Use first row as column names: If the first row of a spreadsheet contains the column names, tick this box.
Convert rows to columns: Ticking this box will group all rows in the data source into a single row, numbering the column names in the process. For example a spreadsheet
with Name and Description and 3 rows will become Name1, Description1, Name2, Description2, Name3, Description3 with all data contained in a single row.

When ready click OK to complete setting up the new Data Source.

To remove a data source, simply click the Delete button
Mapping a Data Source to a Title
Once one more Data Sources have been added, they can be easily assigned to any Title input from within vMix.
(See Setting up a new Data Source for help on setting up a new Data Source)

Right click a Title input from within vMix and click Title Editor from the menu.


Select one of the Title fields from the left hand column (such as Headline, Description etc) then click Data Source from the top menu bar.




Select the Data Source and other settings such as Table and Column.

Table: Select the table you wish to source the data from. Some data sources may only have a default table available to select here.
Column: Select the column to use for this particular Title Field, if you leave this set to Auto, the data source will map based on the following:
Will first look for the first column with the same name as the Title field, for example "Headline"
If no column is found, use the column index that matches the Title field index. For example Headline would be Column1, Description Column2 and so on.

Format: This option can be used to add additional text to the data, for example "Name: {0}" will output the data as "Name: Bob"

A preview will be displayed showing the data that will be assigned to the title.


Click OK and the data will automatically populate the text box in the Title Editor




Repeat steps 1 to 4 for each Title field you wish to assign to data.

Controlling Data Sources
Once a Data Source has been added and assigned to a title, it may contain a number of rows you want to select from, for example a list of speakers
during a conference.

There are a number of methods to select rows that are described in the following section. When a row is selected, all Titles that refer to that data source will update automatically.

Using the Data Sources Manager

For manual control, select any data source from the buttons along the top and click a row in the table to select it.

To automatically move down the list, click the Auto Next button so that it lights up green and type in the number of seconds between each row in the provided text box.
Click Loop to jump to the start of the list after the last row.

TIP: The Data Sources window can be left option and setup on a separate monitor for quick and easy access.

Using Shortcuts
A number of Shortcut Functions are available for controlling data sources such as DataSourceNextRow, DataSourcePreviousRow and DataSourceSelectRow
These are described in the Shortcut Function Reference guide.

Editing the Data Source directly
As all Data Sources automatically update, you can control what data is sent by moving things around at the source, consider the following example:

A Title mapped to a Excel data source with the first row selected
The Excel file is open on another computer

The computer that has opened the excel file can move or copy the data they wish select into the first row and click save.
Each time they click save, the data will update in vMix.





Using Images in Data Sources
If your title includes an image field, this can also be assigned to a data source.
The data source text data must be either a full URL or file path in order to load correctly.
For example

http://www.example.com/image.jpg c:\images\logo.png

How to create a Google API Key for Google Sheets

Troubleshooting / FAQ

Setting up a Call
Setting up a Call
Click Add Input in vMix then select the Video Call tab:




Host a Call: Select this button to host a new call for a remote guest (default)
Connect to Call: Connect to an existing call on another vMix PC.

Password: This is an automatically generated number that can be used to identify the call and allow the remote guest to connect.

Return Feed (To Guest): The following settings control what the guest sees and hears on their end.

Video Source: Select either Output 1, Output 2-4 (4K and Pro editions only) or None as the return video feed the remote guest will see
If None is selected, no audio or video will be sent to the remote guest, this is useful for situations where you need a remote feed only and don't expect to interact
with the caller.

Video Bandwidth: Select the video quality and bandwidth of the return video.
NOTE: This setting is the same for all guests and cannot be configured independently.

Audio Source: Select the audio mix to send back as the audio the guest will hear.
Note that regardless of the setting selected, Auto Mix Minus will be applied so that the guest will never hear themselves back again as an echo.
Selecting Master here is usually recommended as using Bus A to G to apply a Mix Minus is not necessary.

Allow only direct peer to peer connections: Sometimes due to firewall and network restrictions a call may go via one of the vMix servers which may not be desirable due to increased latency and lower video quality.
Tick this box to force peer to peer connections only when establishing a call. If the call does not connect all when this is ticked, a firewall will be blocking UDP traffic on either side.

Show Advanced Options: These options should only be selected when diagnosing call issues as directed to by the vMix support team.

Click OK to add this call as an Input in vMix




Direct your guest to visit www.vmixcall.com using any Google Chrome or Firefox browser with a Webcam and Microphone connected.
The guest should type in any Name to identify themselves and the generated Password and then click Join Call

After a brief connection process you should see the remote guests video and audio

To end the call, the guest can click the red phone icon from their toolbar.

The input can also be closed in vMix, however it is possible to reuse the Password for subsequent calls in the future.

To add additional guests, repeat these steps as many times as needed.


Call Manager / Chat
vMix Call includes a call manager window that provides the ability to monitor all calls and text chat with guests.

Open the Call Manager by right clicking any vMix Call input and selecting Open Call Manager from the menu.

Call Manager Window




The Call Manager window lists the Name, Password and Receiver Statistics for each caller along the top panel from left to right, in the same order as the inputs in vMix.

TIP: Click any of the coloured panels to change what is displayed between Name + Password, Name + Input Title and Name.

The colour of the box listing the Name and Password indicates the status of that particular call.

Green: Call is connected and audio and video is coming in smoothly
Red: Call is either disconnected or no audio and video is being received
Amber: Call is experiencing dropped frames or missing audio due to current network conditions. See Troubleshooting for more information on call connection and quality issues.
Chat
The chat window allows sending and receiving text messages to all currently connected guests.
Any message typed into this window will be seen by all guest in vMix, and any message sent by a guest will be seen by both vMix and any other guests within the same vMix session.

Status information may also appear in the chat list, indicating when a guest logged in with their browser and the progress of the connection.

Statistics
Statistics appear below the Guest's name during each call as described below:

1280x720 1958 kbps 30fps 250 ms

From left to right this indicates the video resolution received from the guest, their current video bandwidth, frame rate and jitter buffer latency.

48000hz 6 kbps 293 ms


From left to right this indicates the audio sample rate from the guest, their current audio bandwidth and jitter buffer latency.

Advanced Statistics
Advanced diagnostic information can be found by clicking the  button


Audio and Talkback
vMix Call provides three different audio feed options that can be sent to all guests.
All three include built in automatic mix minus, so regardless of the option selected the guest microphone audio will not be returned back to them.

Master
This is the default and simplest option where the guest will hear the same audio as the stream and recording, minus their microphone.

Headphones
This option will allow the guest to hear everything the vMix operator hears, minus their microphone. This allows the vMix operator to Solo any audio sources in the audio mixer they want the guest to hear without being heard on the recoding or stream.

This is useful for Talkback scenarios where a producer's microphone and guests are muted with solo turned on, creating a private conversation
between the producer's and guests that the audience can't hear until they are unmuted.

Bus A, Bus B, Bus C, Bus D, Bus E, Bus F, Bus G
vMix provides seven independent audio mixes / buses in addition to Master and Headphones which can be controlled using the A and B toggle buttons
underneath each audio input in vMix. (right click these buttons to see Bus C-G) For more information see the Audio Buses section of Audio Mixer.

These separate audio buses allow full flexibility when configuring guests audio in advanced production scenarios.

For example, a "virtual green room" could be created whereby any waiting guests can be turned on in Bus A to talk amongst themselves
with the M or Master being turned on just before they go on air.

When using this option, be sure to enable any sources before hand you wish the guests to hear such as the interviewer's microphone and any video clips
they might need to hear as well.

Troubleshooting / FAQ
Recommended Guest/Caller Requirements
For best results, the following is recommended for each guest/caller: Intel Laptop/PC from 2009 or higher
Windows 10

Google Chrome 56 or higher
HD USB Webcam such as the Logitech C920
Headset/Mic combo or Earphones + USB Microphone such as the Yeti from Blue Microphones

Guest is able to connect but no video and audio is received
Check to make sure the caller has a Webcam and Microphone plugged in and these have been selected in the browser.
In Google Chrome the camera and microphone can be configured by clicking the grey Camera icon at the top right hand corner of the address bar.
In FireFox, the browser will prompt to select the camera and microphone each time the call is connected.


Guest dropped out, video/audio is no longer being received
This may occur if the internet connection is interrupted. The caller simply needs to refresh/reload the browser page to reconnect automatically.

Guest is flashing orange/amber in the Call Manager
This indicates network congestion between vMix and the caller.
The video and audio from the caller will adapt automatically after several seconds, however if the Return Video bandwidth is too high for the callers
internet connection, then you may need to select a lower quality by right clicking the Call input in vMix.


Guest's video/audio is low quality
vMix Call adapts to the available network conditions which may result in low quality video and audio if the callers network upload speed is lower than 2Mbps
Audio quality may also briefly drop to Telephone quality during periods of network congestion If network congestion can be ruled out, try a different webcam.
Guest's video/audio is not smooth
During periods of network congestion, the received frame rate may drop as low as 1 frame per second.

The video frame rate may also lower in response to camera lighting or performance limits of the caller's laptop, PC or mobile device.

High Latency
vMix Call uses what is known as a Jitter Buffer which adds a variable amount of latency to each call to ensure smooth video and synchronised audio.
This latency can range from approx 200ms for guests on the same or nearby network to between 1 and 1.5 seconds for guests located on different continents or on congested networks.

As vMix Call will generally adapt to the worst case scenario, if a brief period of network congestion results in higher than expected latency during a call, the guest can refresh their browser
to re-establish the call and reset the Jitter Buffer.

Audio echo from guest
Check to make sure the guest is using headphones/earphones instead of speakers to ensure the return audio is not feeding back through their microphone.
If speakers must be used (such as in a boardroom environment), the Microphone will need to be directional to ensure it is not picking up the speakers audio.


Right click menu settings
A number of settings can be adjusted for calls on the fly through the right click menu on each call input.


Open Call Manager

Disconnect

Disconnect the call. The guest will need to either refresh their browser or if using vMix right click and select Reconnect to connect again.

Video Source / Audio Source

Select a custom video and/or audio source to send the guest on this particular input.

Return Video Bandwidth (To Guest)

Select the video quality to send back to the guest from vMix. As this is generally used for preview purposes by the guest
it is recommended to select this as low as practical.
NOTE: This setting is the same for all guests and cannot be configured independently.

Advanced Settings
Remote Guest Video Bandwidth

NOTE: This applies only to guests connecting using a browser as vMix callers will have specified their own bandwidth manually.
Manually select the maximum bandwidth the guest can use when sending video to vMix. This is set to Auto by default which will adapt to internet conditions automatically.

Allow only direct peer to peer connections

See the Setting up a Call section on this topic for more information.

GT Title Designer

GT Designer is an easy to use application for creating title and lower third templates for use with vMix. These templates are high quality, GPU accelerated and support animations in the 4K and Pro editions of vMix.

PlayLists are linked to the currently active Preset in vMix. This means any saved playlists can only be loaded alongside the preset in which they were created.

MultiCorder

MultiCorder is an advanced feature found in the 4K and Pro editions of vMix.
It provides the ability to record the raw video and audio from capture inputs to separate files in addition to the main vMix Recording.

Note: Instant Replay and MultiCorder cannot be used at the same time.

MultiCorder has the following minimum system requirements:

Solid State Disk (SSD) for storing recordings.
Intel Core i7 Quad Core processor or higher
High end graphics card with at least 1GB of on board memory

The number of simultaneous recordings and the type of recording formats will depend on the processing capabilities of the computer.


The interface above appears by clicking the Cog Button next to MultiCorder in the main interface.


All available Camera, NDI inputs are listed within the MultiCorder window along with the four Output channels. Tick the source you wish to record and click Start.
SRT inputs can also be recorded, however please note that SRT will always be recorded in its native Transport Stream (.ts) format and any recording settings except the recording folder will be ignored.

NOTE: Any source with irregular timing such as NDI-HX, Desktop Capture and vMix Call are not supported by MultiCorder and should not be used.

The following options are also available:

Recording Format
vMix AVI, AVI, MKV, MP4 and FFMPEG are available as recording options in MultiCorder. For more information about these formats see Recording Setup.

Fault Tolerant Recordings
It is recommended that a fault tolerant recording format is selected when using MultiCorder. This means in the event of a power outage, the recording will still be recoverable.
See Fault Tolerant Recordings for a list of options available.

Folder
Select the folder to place the video files. This will need to be a fast storage device as listed above under the system requirements.
The more cameras that are recorded simultaneously, the greater chance of dropped frames if the storage device is unable to keep up.

Audio
Select and audio source to include with each recording. This can either be Input which includes the embedded audio in the source, or Master to record the main audio mix.
Note: If recording one of the Output channels (Output 1-4) the audio recorded will always match the audio bus selected in Settings - Outputs / NDI for that particular output.

New File Every
Split the recording into a new file every x Minutes.

Record NDI in original MOV format
When recording NDI sources, you can select to record in the same compression format as NDI itself (MOV) by checking this tickbox.
This allows recording NDI sources without any additional system load or CPU usage as the video does not need to be re-compressed.

When recording NDI in this mode, all MultiCorder settings except the recording folder are ignored, including audio source and "new file every".

Change Recording Folder
Each source can be saved into its own folder or storage by highlighting the item in the list and selecting Change Recording Folder.
To change the folder of two or more sources, highlight them in the list before selecting Change Recording Folder.
To change all sources to the same folder again, deselect all items then select Change Recording Folder.

Video
MOV, MXF
To enable additional file types for full interlaced processing, add them to the FFMPEG section of Settings -> Decoders
All other formats will be converted to progressive using Blend deinterlacing
List
Same as for Video above
Interlaced can be set for each video independently.
Image Sequence
Yes, one image per field
Each image in an image sequence is treated as a field when using an interlaced output. For example, 50 images are needed for 1 second of 50i video.
Video Delay
Yes, saved clips progressive
Saved clips are saved as Interlaced but will playback in vMix as Progressive only

Recording
NOTE: Interlaced Recording must be checked under Settings -> Recording

Interlaced recording is supported for AVI and MPEG-2 formats by setting the Recording Frame Rate to 50i,
59.94i or 60i
All recordings are Upper Field First with the exception of NTSC 480i which is Lower Field First

MP4 and WMV support progressive recording only.

External Output
NOTE: Interlaced Recording must be checked under Settings -> Recording

Interlaced recording is supported by setting the Frame Rate to 50i, 59.94i or 60i in External Output

Fullscreen Display
Fullscreen and preview windows will display the first field only when the Master Frame Rate is set to 50i,

59.94i or 60i
For full field display, set the Master Frame Rate to 50p or higher.

Statistics

The statistics window can be displayed by clicking the icon in the bottom right hand corner as shown below


This window displays real time statistics of each live input including dropped frames and audio sync. Each column is described in detail below:
Source Dropped
This shows the number of dropped frames as a result of the capture card / camera running slowly.
For example, the camera clock might be slower than vMix or the capture card is experiencing a bandwidth bottleneck.

Renderer Dropped
This shows the number of dropped frames as a result of the graphics card running slowly.

Resync
This number shows the number of dropped frames as a result of the capture card / camera running too fast. For example, the camera clock might be running slightly faster than vMix.

Video
This column shows timing statistics relating to the arrival time of each frame from the source.

Example: 33 33 33 33 (49)
In the above example, the four previous frames arrived 33 milliseconds after each other (indicating approx. 30 fps)

The number in brackets shows how long it took for the frame to displayed on screen. (1.5 frames in this case)

These numbers will coincide with the results seen in the other dropped columns.

If a 30p camera shows 38 38 38 38 consistently, this indicates that it is running slow. This will show up in the Source Dropped column.

If a 30p camera shows 25 25 25 25 consistently, this indicates that is running fast. This will show up in the Resync column.

Audio
This column shows timing statistics relating to the arrival time of each sample of audio from the source.

Example: 60/67 ms Dropped: 2/0 Resampled: 0/40

60/67 ms


These values show the fullness of the audio buffer.

Dropped: 2/0

Number of dropped audio samples read/write.

Resampled: 0/40

Number of milliseconds of audio that has been resampled to stay in sync.

Snapshot

A snapshot of the live production (that is a still image taken at a particular point in time) can be created in one of the following ways:

Output Snapshot

Click the camera icon to take a Snapshot of the final vMix Output. This will browse to save the file as a PNG, JPEG or BMP image. If saved as a PNG, transparency is preserved, where applicable.


Input Snapshot

Right click the cog icon under an input to take a Snapshot of that particular input at full resolution. This will browse to save the file as a PNG, JPEG or BMP image.
If saved as a PNG, transparency is preserved, where applicable.


Padlock

The Padlock icon in the bottom right hand corner of vMix can be used to lock certain buttons in vMix so they are not clicked accidentally.
When the icon is grey and open, everything is unlocked, when the icon is orange and closed, the functions below are locked:

vMix Close Button
Input Close Button
Open Preset
Last Preset
Recording Stop
Streaming Stop
External Output Stop
MultiCorder Stop

Scripting and Automation

4K and Pro editions of vMix include powerful programming capabilities through the Scripting feature.

Consider this is a highly advanced version of Shortcuts, instead of a simple function assigned to a keyboard key
you can assign any code you can think of including tasks like downloading internet content and assigning it to a title.

The process goes like this:

Create a Script from the Scripting tab in Settings and assign it a unique Name.

Create a Shortcut and select "ScriptStart" as the function and type in the name of the script in the Script Name box.

Scripting supports two different languages when writing your script:

VB.NET Scripting

Web Scripting

Local Scripts
Similar to shortcuts, scripts can be globally (accessible regardless of what Preset is open) or locally (only loaded with a particular Preset)
When editing a script, tick the box Local Script (This Preset Only) if you would like the script saved in the Preset.

Local scripts show up as Bold in the list. If two scripts have the same name, the first in the list will always be used when using shortcuts that refer to a script by name.



VB.NET Scripting
vMix Scripting supports the powerful and easy to understand VB.NET language when writing your script.

Hello World Example
Consider the following vMix take on the infamous "Hello World" application:


Or put another way:


Both of these scripts do the same thing, that is to find the Title Input with name "NewsHD.xaml" and assign the "Headline" field with the text "Hello World!"
To try it out add the NewsHD.xaml title template to vMix and then run the script.

VB.NET


vMix Scripting supports the majority of VB.NET 2.0 code that will work within a single sub or function.
This means that custom classes and structures are not supported, however you can use the vast majority of the built in base classes in the .NET framework
including the handy System.Net.WebClient for downloading data over the internet.

vMix Objects
There are a number of built in objects that can be used from within vMix scripting:

Input
Shared Properties

Output As Input Preview As Input
Find(inputNameNumberOrKey as String) As Input
Example:


Instance Properties

Text(Optional fieldName As String = "") As String

Change the text of a Field within an Title input, or read the current value

Instance Methods

Function(functionName As String, Optional value As String = "", Optional duration As Integer = 0, Optional selectedName As String = "", Optional selectedIndex As Integer = 0)
Function can be used to call any Shortcut function in vMix

WaitForCompletion(timeoutMilliseconds As Integer) As Boolean

Wait for a video to finish playing and return True, otherwise return False if timed out.

Overlay
Shared Properties

Find(number as Integer) As Overlay
Instance Methods

In(input as String) Out
Off
Examples:




Console
Shared Methods

WriteLine(message as String)

Write the message string to the vMix Script console accessible from the Scripting tab of Settings. This is useful for debugging purposes

Examples:


API
Shared Methods

XML() As String
Returns the XML state of vMix as per the vMix Web API
Function(functionName As String, Optional input As String = "", Optional value As String
= "", Optional duration As Integer = 0, Optional selectedName As String = "", Optional selectedIndex As Integer = 0)

Calls an API function as per the vMix Web API

Examples:


Web Scripting
Web Scripting supports a basic URL syntax to execute multiple functions one after the other.

Example


Syntax
The syntax for each line is the same as the query string used with the but vMix Web API without the URL portion

For example http://localhost:8088/API/?Function=Cut in the Web API would be just Function=Cut with Web Scripting

All the same parameters apply for example:


The only exception is the Sleep command which is unique to Web Scripting and will pause for a number of milliseconds between two functions.
URL encoding may need to be used when using special characters in the Value parameter.

Developer Information

vMix provides the following interfaces for developers: HTTP Web API
TCP API




HTTP WEB API
The vMix API provides access to common functions through the HTTP protocol.
For example, the following command will signal vMix to fade Preview to Active within 1 second:


Setup
The API uses the same web address as the standard Web Interface and can be configured from the Web tab in Settings.

Parameters
Function

Specify a function to execute.
This can be any of the functions provided for the Shortcuts feature.
To view a list of what is possible, in vMix go to Settings, Shortcuts and click Add. All the functions in the "Function" dropdown box can be called from the API.

Click here to view a list of some of the Shortcut Functions that are available.

Duration

If the specified function is a transition this parameter can be set to a time in milliseconds.

Input

Input can be used to specify the Input in one of three ways:
By number starting from 1.
0 can be used for Preview and -1 for Active.

By name. (note that it is case sensitive, and requires the full title name including spaces)

A GUID can be used to specify an exact input. The GUID can be found from the "Key" attribute in the XML.
For example:

http://127.0.0.1:8088/API/?Function=Fade&Duration=1000&Input=877bb3e7-58bd-46a1-85ce-0d673aec6bf5

SelectedName

When using Title or XAML inputs, SelectedName can be used to specify the name of the text field to modify.
For example:

http://127.0.0.1:8088/API/?Function=SetText&Input=877bb3e7-58bd-46a1-85ce- 0d673aec6bf5&SelectedName=Headline&Value=Hello

When using GT titles, the name should include ".Text" at the end for text fields and ".Source" at the end for images or rectangles with brush images.
For reference, these full names are displayed in the Title Editor built into vMix. For example:
http://127.0.0.1:8088/API/?Function=SetText&Input=877bb3e7-58bd-46a1-85ce- 0d673aec6bf5&SelectedName=Headline.Text&Value=Hello

http://127.0.0.1:8088/API/?Function=SetImage&Input=877bb3e7-58bd-46a1-85ce- 0d673aec6bf5&SelectedName=MyImage.Source&Value=filename.jpg

SelectedIndex

Specify an index to pass to the input
The following Inputs support the SelectedIndex parameter:

VideoList: Specify the video to play starting from 1 Virtual Set: Specify the camera zoom to transition to Title: Specify the text item to configure starting from 0


Value

Value is used with many different API Functions including the following.
For a full list of functions that use Value parameters refer to the Shortcut Function Reference.

SetImage: Specify the image to display in an image field within a supported XAML or Title input
SetText: Specify the text to display in the text field specified by SelectedIndex above.
SetPosition: In milliseconds SetCountdown: As a timespan (00:00:00) SetFader: As a number between 0 and 255
AddInput: Specify the Video/Image/Photos or Xaml input filename in the following formats:

Video|c:\filename.wmv Image|c:\filename.jpg
...

Mix

In the 4K and Pro editions up to three separate Mix inputs are available.
This parameter can be used to select the Mix to use where 0 = main mix, 1 = first Mix input, 2 = second Mix input etc.

Channel

Some replay functions can be applied to a specific channel. If this parameter is left blank it will default to the currently selected channel in the Replay user interface.
The value should be A, B, Current or left blank.

Return
If successful, the API will return the standard 200 response code.

If an error occurs, the API will return the standard 500 error code.

Information
If all parameters are left blank the API will return state information in XML format. The following is an example of the XML output:

<vmix>
<version>11.0.0.16</version>
<inputs>
<input key="26cae087-b7b6-4d45-98e4-de03ab4feb6b" number="1" type="Xaml" title="NewsHD.xaml" state="Paused" position="0" duration="0" muted="True" loop="False" selectedIndex="0"> NewsHD.xaml
<text index="0" name="Headline">Hello</text>
<text index="1" name="Description">Hello</text>
</input>
<input key="55cbe357-a801-4d54-8ff2-08ee68766fae" number="2" type="VirtualSet" title="LateNightNews" state="Paused" position="0" duration="0" muted="True" loop="False" selectedIndex="0">
LateNightNews
<overlay index="0" key="2fe8ff9d-e400-4504-85ab-df7c17a1edd4"/>
<overlay index="1" key="20e4ee9a-05cc-4f58-bb69-cd179e1c1958"/>
<overlay index="2" key="94b88db0-c5cd-49d8-98a2-27d83d4bf3fe"/>
</input>
</inputs>
<overlays>
<overlay number="1"/>
<overlay number="2">1</overlay>
<overlay number="3"/>
<overlay number="4"/>
<overlay number="5"/>
<overlay number="6"/>
</overlays>
<preview>1</preview>
<active>2</active>
<fadeToBlack>False</fadeToBlack>
<transitions>
<transition number="1" effect="Fade" duration="500"/>
<transition number="2" effect="Wipe" duration="500"/>
<transition number="3" effect="Fly" duration="500"/>
<transition number="4" effect="CubeZoom" duration="3000"/>
</transitions>
<recording>False</recording>
<external>False</external>
<streaming>False</streaming>
<playList>False</playList>
<multiCorder>False</multiCorder>
</vmix>

In the example above Input 2 is active and Input 1 is currently running as Overlay 2.

TCP API
The vMix TCP API provides the same functionality as the HTTP WEB API but with lower processing overhead making it suitable for use in embedded devices that have limited XML parsing capabilities.
It also provides the ability to subscribe to a TALLY event that will automatically send TALLY updates to the client.

Preface

The vMix TCP API is designed to be a simple protocol that can be expanded in the future without breaking compatibility with existing clients.
Therefore it employs a simple text command/response architecture, similar to other standard protocols such as SMTP.
As a result, fixed length binary structures have been avoided.
The <> symbols in this specification refer to mandatory commands/responses while [] are always optional.

Connection
TCP connection on fixed port 8099

Formatting
All messages are UTF8 encoded and \r\n terminated unless specified otherwise.
This is compatible with ASCII only devices for the vast majority of commands with the exception of those that might retrieve incompatible characters such as in Titles.

Responses
Responses are space delimited \r\n terminated strings with optional binary data in the following format:

<command> <status/length> [response]\r\n [data]

Examples:
MYCOMMAND OK This is the response to MYCOMMAND\r\n
MYCOMMAND ER This is an error message in response to MYCOMMAND\r\n MYCOMMAND 28\r\n
This is optional binary data
MYCOMMAND 28 This is a message in addition to the binary data\r\n This is optional binary data

Notes:
Optional binary data is the exact length specified in <status/length> including additional terminating characters such as \r\n
which are always appended to the end of multiline text such as from XMLTEXT.
Single line responses such as ER should always be expected and handled, even for commands that usually return binary data.
OK (Success), ER (Error) and length are the only three statuses to expect.

Events
Events are responses that can be sent at any time to the client in response to state changes.
All clients should be written to handle any response at any time, as these may be received in the middle of sending a command but before
receiving that particular commands response. Therefore it is recommended clients operate "asynchronously" without waiting for a particular command response.

Commands
TALLY
Event Supported: Yes Example Request: TALLY\r\n
Example Response: TALLY OK 0121...\r\n
Description: Returns a list of tally values where 0 = off, 1 = program, 2 = preview.
The list is padded to the total number of inputs currently added to vMix and may have up to 1000 entries as a result.
(Maximum possible length = 9 + 1000 + 2 = 1011 bytes)

FUNCTION
Format: FUNCTION <Function> [QueryString]\r\n Example Request: FUNCTION PreviewInput Input=5\r\n
Example Request: FUNCTION SetText Input=3&SelectedName=Headline&Value=Hello world\r\n Example Response: FUNCTION OK PreviewInput\r\n
Example Response: FUNCTION ER Error message\r\n
Description: Calls a Shortcut Function with optional Query String. This Query String exactly matches the syntax
and layout of HTTP WEB API. Standard URL escape/encoding characters should be used.

ACTS
Event Supported: Yes
Format: ACTS <ActivatorName> [InputNumber]\r\n Example Request: ACTS Input 1\r\n
Example Response: ACTS OK Input 1 1\r\n
Description: Retrieves the current state of an Activator. This can be used even if a particular activator has not been added in vMix and is handy
for retrieving state information for use with custom controllers.
To subscribe to all activator events use the command SUBSCRIBE ACTS. This will retrieve all events as it is not possible to subscribe to only a particular activator.
The input number can be left blank for Input, InputPreview and Overlay1,2,3,4 to show the currently assigned input, if any, otherwise ER No Input will be returned.
Return values will always be between 0 and 1. In contrast to the XML output this means boolean True/False becomes 1/0 and integer values such as Volume become 32bit floating point values.

XML
Example Request: XML\r\n Example Response: XML 37\r\n
<vmix><version>x.x.x.x</version></vmix>
Description: Returns the current XML state as binary data encoded in UTF-8 format.
The data length has no size limit and can be quite large, therefore embedded devices should use the XML parsing commands below to efficiently retrieve values.

XMLTEXT
Format: XMLTEXT XPATH
Example Request: XMLTEXT vmix/inputs/input[1]/@title\r\n
Example Response: XMLTEXT OK This is the title of the first input\r\n Example Request: XMLTEXT vmix/inputs/input[6]/text[@name='Headline']\r\n
Example Response: XMLTEXT OK This is the value of Headline text field in title input that is the number 6 (index 5) input.\r\n
Description: Uses the XPATH syntax to retrieve individual text values of the XML state.
To simplify parsing, multiline text will use the status length, while single line data will always use a single line response.

SUBSCRIBE
Format: SUBSCRIBE <COMMAND>\r\n Example Request: SUBSCRIBE TALLY\r\n Example Response: SUBSCRIBE OK TALLY\r\n
Description: Subscribe to an event/command. Event responses matching the selected command may begin immediately, even before the SUBSCRIBE response is received.
Event responses will continue to be received until either a. UNSUBSCRIBE is called or b. the connection is closed.

UNSUBSCRIBE
Format: UNSUBSCRIBE <COMMAND>\r\n
Example Request: UNSUBSCRIBE TALLY\r\n Example Response: UNSUBSCRIBE OK TALLY\r\n
Description: Due to the internal event queue in vMix, event responses may continue to be received briefly after the UNSUBSCRIBE command has been called.

QUIT
Description: Closes the connection
Custom XAML
Warning: The following API is deprecated as of vMix 24 and may be removed in a future update.

vMix supports the use of custom WPF User Controls compiled into an assembly.

Custom User Controls can implement the vMixWPFUserControl interface from the vMixInterop.dll in the vMix installation directory.
This interface allows vMix to communicate with the User Control and gather duration and position information.

Implementation Guidelines
All controls must be compatible with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (4.0 is not supported at this time)
ShowProperties should display a WinForms window without blocking (Form.Show instead of Form.ShowDialog)
Displaying WPF windows through ShowProperties is untested and unsupported.
Any code within ShowProperties will not run in the context of the WPF UI thread so the use of Dispatcher is required to modify UI elements.
All other methods run within the WPF UI thread so cpu intensive procedures should be avoided to prevent frame drops.
Any media related controls such as MediaElement and WebBrowser are not supported and will display a blank window.

How to add a Custom WPF User Control to vMix
First make sure the user control has been compiled as a DLL and follows the implementation guidelines above.
Click Add Input in vMix and then select the Title / XAML tab
Click Browse and browse for the DLL file and click OK
Click OK and the control will now be available in vMix.
If you have built custom properties through the ShowProperties function, this can be displayed through a right click menu:


Shortcut Function Reference

The following shortcut functions can be called either via a Shortcut or via the API.

Fade, Zoom, Cut Etc: Assign a keyboard key to a transition effect. The duration can also be selected.

Safe Areas

Safe Areas for the Preview Window can be enabled by clicking the icon at the top right hand corner of the Preview Title Bar as shown below.


A number of display options are supported including EBU/SMPTE, 80/90% and grids of various sizes. Safe Areas can also be displayed and controlled from the Input Settings window.

Undo Button

After completing an action in vMix, an Undo button may appear next to the Preset buttons at the top right of vMix


Press this button to undo that action.
Currently the following actions are supported with more expected to be added in the future.

Closing Inputs

Waveform and Vectorscope Monitor

The professional waveform monitor can be turned on within the Preview window and the Input settings window by clicking the colour bar icon as shown below.



Waveform RGB
Displays a waveform of the red, green and blue colour channels on top of each other as shown below.



Waveform Y
Displays the Luminance waveform only.

Parade RGB
Displays three separate waveforms representing the three colour channels Red, Green and Blue.


Vectorscope

Graphs the chrominance portion of the video (Cb,Cr or U,V channels) as an X/Y plot.

Colour squares indicators representing 75% and 100% Red, Magenta, Blue, Cyan, Green and Yellow are displayed at the relevant points
for easy calibration. For example the lines on a standard colour bars or test chart (such as those provided in Add Input -> Colour) will line up perfectly
with the coloured squares when the colour is calibrated correctly. Thus using a test chart on a camera source will allow accurate colour correction to be achieved.


Preview

Some monitoring options have a + Preview option which shows the monitor side by side with a live video preview of the input.
