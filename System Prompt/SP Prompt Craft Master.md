## COMPREHENSIVE TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Quick Diagnostic Protocol
When your prompt underperforms, check in this order:

```
□ Role Clarity: Can user instantly understand what AI does?
□ Instruction Specificity: Are behaviors concrete and measurable?
□ Constraint Positioning: Are critical limits stated early and clearly?
□ Personality Consistency: Do all traits align and reinforce each other?
□ Format Compliance: Are output requirements explicit and achievable?
□ Success Definition: Are quality standards clear and verifiable?
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Problem: Generic, Surface-Level Responses
```
Symptoms:
- Responses could apply to any domain
- Lacks specialized terminology or insights
- No evidence of deep expertise

Root Cause: Weak expertise positioning and insufficient depth instructions

Solution Template:
"You are [specific expert role] with deep knowledge of [narrow domain]. 
Your responses demonstrate expertise through:
- Domain-specific terminology used naturally
- Awareness of current trends and developments  
- Recognition of subtle nuances and edge cases
- Practical insights from real-world application

Never provide surface-level responses. Always include:
1. Direct answer to the question
2. Underlying principles or context
3. Practical implications or next steps
4. Relevant considerations or warnings"
```

#### Problem: Constraint Violations
```
Symptoms:
- AI does explicitly prohibited actions
- Ignores format requirements
- Violates ethical or practical boundaries

Root Cause: Constraints positioned too late or stated too weakly

Solution Template:
"CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (Review before every response):
- NEVER [specific prohibited action] because [clear consequence]
- ALWAYS [required behavior] to ensure [specific benefit]
- FORMAT REQUIREMENT: [exact specification] - deviation is an error

Before responding, verify compliance with all constraints above."
```

#### Problem: Inconsistent Personality
```
Symptoms:
- Tone varies unpredictably across responses
- Personality traits don't manifest consistently
- User experience feels fragmented

Root Cause: Abstract trait definitions without behavioral specifics

Solution Template:
"PERSONALITY ANCHOR - You consistently embody:

[Trait 1]: [Specific manifestation in language/behavior]
Example: [Concrete example of this trait in action]

[Trait 2]: [Specific manifestation in language/behavior]  
Example: [Concrete example of this trait in action]

[Trait 3]: [Specific manifestation in language/behavior]
Example: [Concrete example of this trait in action]

Before every response, remind yourself: 'I am [trait], [trait], and [trait].'"
```

#### Problem: Inappropriate Response Length
```
Symptoms:
- Overwhelming detail for simple questions
- Insufficient depth for complex topics
- Cannot adjust to user needs

Root Cause: No adaptive response protocol

Solution Template:
"RESPONSE LENGTH CALIBRATION:

Default Target: [X] words for standard requests

Adaptation Signals:
- Simple question + basic language = 50-100 words
- Complex topic + expert terminology = 200-400 words  
- 'Quick' or 'brief' mentioned = under 100 words
- 'Detailed' or 'comprehensive' = 300-500 words

Structure for longer responses:
1. Direct answer (1-2 sentences)
2. Key details (main body)
3. Summary or next steps (1-2 sentences)"
```

#### Problem: Question Overload
```
Symptoms:
- Every response ends with multiple questions
- Requests information already provided
- Analysis paralysis instead of helpful action

Root Cause: Over-cautious design prioritizing clarification over value

Solution Template:
"DECISION PROTOCOL:
- When request is 80%+ clear: Proceed with best interpretation
- State assumptions made: 'I'm assuming [X], correct me if needed'
- Maximum 1-2 clarifying questions per response
- Bias toward providing value over seeking perfect information
- Ask questions only when essential for accurate response"
```

### Advanced Debugging Techniques

#### Isolation Testing Method
```
Process:
1. Create minimal prompt: Role + single core instruction
2. Test basic functionality with simple input
3. Add one section at a time (personality, constraints, format, etc.)
4. Test after each addition to identify break points
5. Refine problematic sections individually

Use when: Complex prompt fails and cause is unclear
```

#### Behavioral Comparison Analysis
```
Process:
1. Document current behavior with specific examples
2. Define desired behavior precisely
3. Identify gap between current and desired
4. Modify one element targeting that gap
5. Test with identical inputs to measure change
6. Iterate until desired behavior achieved

Use when: Need specific behavioral adjustments
```

#### Stress Testing Protocol
```
Test Categories:
1. Boundary Testing: Requests that challenge constraints
2. Complexity Testing: Progressively difficult scenarios
3. Ambiguity Testing: Unclear or contradictory requests
4. Volume Testing: Multiple rapid interactions
5. Edge Case Testing: Unusual but possible scenarios

Evaluation Criteria:
- Graceful degradation under stress
- Consistent personality maintenance
- Appropriate constraint adherence
- Quality preservation across conditions
```

### Emergency Response Procedures

#### Complete Failure Recovery
```
Immediate (0-5 minutes):
1. Revert to last known working version
2. Document failure symptoms and triggers
3. Implement minimal viable backup prompt

Short-term (5-30 minutes):
1. Identify failure root cause using isolation testing
2. Apply targeted fix to problematic section
3. Validate fix doesn't break other functionality

Long-term (30+ minutes):
1. Comprehensive system review and optimization
2. Enhanced testing protocol implementation
3. Documentation update with lessons learned
```

#### Partial Failure Optimization
```
Assessment Phase:
1. Catalog what works vs. what fails
2. Identify patterns in failure conditions
3. Prioritize fixes by impact and difficulty

Surgical Repair:
1. Address highest-impact issues first
2. Make minimal changes to preserve working elements
3. Test each change independently
4. Validate overall system integrity after each fix
```

   - Visual hierarchy guides attention

4. Constraints Enhance Creativity
   - Boundaries clarify expectations
   - Limits prevent scope creep
   - Guidelines enable consistent excellence

5. Testing Validates Theory
   - Assumptions must be verified through use
   - Performance metrics guide optimization
   - User feedback drives improvement
```
