# The Evolving Landscape of Open Source Artificial Intelligence in Multimedia: Models, Applications, and Future Directions

## Introduction

Understanding open source artificial intelligence in a multimedia context requires a comprehensive definition that goes beyond the traditional concepts of open source software. Open source artificial intelligence refers to a system that is freely available to use, study, modify, and share.1 These features extend to all system components, including datasets, code, and model parameters, and promote a collaborative and transparent approach to AI development.1 This definition is aligned with the principles set by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), known as the global guardian of open source principles.2

The concept of "open source artificial intelligence" is significantly broader than "open source software". While software focuses primarily on source code, open source AI includes the elements that make up an AI model, such as documentation, software code, copyrighted training data, model architecture, and weighting agents, all of which are released under Open Source Licenses (OSL).2 For example, the European AI Act defines "free and open source AI" as "artificial intelligence components [that] are made available under a free and open source license" and specifically refers to model architecture parameters and information.3

It is critical to distinguish between truly open source AI and "open access AI". According to experts in the open source community, simply releasing a model under an open source license (e.g. through open repositories) without providing access to other critical components (such as documentation, methods, weighting factors, or information about the model and its architecture) should not be considered full open source.3 The Open Source AI Definition 1.0 further clarifies that an open source AI system grants four fundamental freedoms: use the system for any purpose without requiring permission; Studying how the system works and inspecting its components; modifying the system for any purpose, including changing its output; and system sharing.4 This comprehensive definition requires that at least three main components are publicly available under these conditions: data (including training data, methodologies, and techniques), code (including model architecture), and model parameters (including weighting factors).3

One of the important aspects of understanding open source artificial intelligence is the evolution of its definition beyond just software. This change in definition has significant implications for industrial adoption. While the traditional "text editor" focused primarily on software code, now for AI, the concept has expanded significantly to include datasets, model parameters, and documentation in addition to code.1 This expansion creates a potential misalignment between pure open source ethics and business practices. For example, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has made it clear that popular models such as Llama 2 do not meet the organization's comprehensive definition of open source artificial intelligence.2 This situation suggests that industry claims about the "openness of artificial intelligence" may not always match the strict criteria of the community. This ambiguity in definition creates important challenges for companies. Adopting models labeled as "open source" without complete transparency about all components (especially training data and parameters), can lead to unforeseen legal liabilities (such as copyright infringement caused by training data), ethical concerns (such as biases caused by undocumented data), and vendor lock-in (if critical components are not accessible). Thus, the true "openness" of an AI system becomes a critical factor in due diligence that affects trust, compliance, and long-term strategic decisions, driving the industry to adhere more closely to the comprehensive definition of open source.

Open source AI plays a pivotal role in democratizing technology and lowering barriers to entry, especially for newcomers to the field or organizations that are unable to invest significant financial resources in AI development, such as small businesses or companies without specialized expertise.2 This cost efficiency is a major advantage, as open source AI models are generally free, allowing companies to save on the upfront costs of developing and training their own models or sourcing them from closed source providers with high subscription prices or licensing fees.2

This approach fosters rapid innovation through global community collaboration. The public availability of codebases allows for real-time inspection, bug discovery, and patch deployment, and often results in fixing vulnerabilities much faster than with closed-source software.6 This collaborative environment accelerates development cycles and encourages the sharing of ideas, driving development forward in ways that proprietary models can rarely match.7

Unique flexibility and customizability are inherent advantages of these models. Unlike closed-source platforms, open-source software allows engineering teams to modify the source code to match exact business requirements, adapt models, and seamlessly integrate them into existing systems. This architectural freedom also eliminates vendor lock-in, a key competitive advantage in an agile environment.5

Transparency in open source artificial intelligence allows for better audit by policymakers in areas where compliance is of utmost importance.2 This transparency is also critical to identifying and correcting biases in AI systems, promoting ethical practices, and strengthening accountability as developers and users understand how AI makes decisions.6

Open source AI, while a powerful driver for the democratization of AI capabilities, poses significant governance challenges. On the one hand, open access and collaborative development accelerate innovation and lower financial and technical barriers to entry.2 This directly leads to increasing the speed of development and expansion of artificial intelligence tools. However, this openness also brings with it quality control issues, lack of proprietary support, and potential security vulnerabilities.2 This situation represents a fundamental trade-off: speed and accessibility versus the need for stability and security. While open source AI rapidly expands AI capabilities, its decentralized nature requires strong governance frameworks, both within projects (e.g. quality control, security patches) and adopters (e.g. internal policies for use, maintenance, and risk management). The rapid innovation promoted by open source must be balanced with responsible deployment, which requires organizations to invest not only in exploiting the technology, but also in managing its inherent complexities and risks. This shows that the future success of open source artificial intelligence depends on the effective governance of society and organizations.

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of open source artificial intelligence in multimedia, including definitional nuances, leading models in different modes, diverse applications, inherent advantages and disadvantages, community and governance structures, and future trends. The goal is to provide a strategic perspective for researchers, developers, and industry stakeholders in this rapidly evolving field.

## I. Fundamentals of Open Source Multimedia Artificial Intelligence

### Basic principles and definitions (such as the "Four Fundamental Freedoms", the OSI definition)

At its core, open source AI adheres to principles that ensure broad access and collaborative development. An open source AI system, as defined by the Open Source AI Definition 1.0, grants users four fundamental freedoms: the freedom to use the system for any purpose without requiring permission; freedom to study how the system works and inspect its components; freedom to modify the system for any purpose, including changing its output; and freedom to share the system.2 These principles are supported by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), which serves as the global overseer of open source policy.2

The scope of open source artificial intelligence is more than just software code. It includes all the elements that make up the AI ​​model, such as documentation, copyrighted training data, model architecture, and weighting factors, all of which should be made available under Open Source Licenses (OSL).3 This holistic view is critical to true openness.

### Key components of open source artificial intelligence models (datasets, code, model parameters, documentation)

For an AI model to truly qualify as open source, especially in the context of the era of generative AI, it must release various components beyond simply making the model itself available. According to experts from the Open Source Community and the European Regulation (Artificial Intelligence Act), a truly open source AI model requires the public availability of at least three main components under conditions that grant the "Four Fundamental Freedoms":

- Data: It includes the training data, methodology and techniques used to develop the model.3 This can include non-copyrighted elements such as personal data (e.g. social media data, although this raises privacy concerns and legal challenges such as class action lawsuits against AI companies for data scraping) and proprietary data such as databases or trade secrets.3 For non-public educational data that cannot be shared, such as personally identifiable information (PII), a detailed description must be provided, including the origin, characteristics, scope, collection and selection methods, labeling procedures, and data processing/filtering methods.2
    
- code: This component includes the software codes and the model architecture itself.3
    
- Model parameters: These are the main parameters of the pre-trained models, including the weighting factors.2
    
- Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is also a critical component that provides information about the model's architecture, usage, and functionality, enabling users to understand, study, and effectively use the model.3 The overall level of openness of an AI model is directly related to the extent to which its inner workings are shared with the public.3
    

### Licensing frameworks and legal consequences (free licenses vs. copyleft, copyright, liability)

Open source licenses (OSLs) come in many forms, from open licenses (such as the MIT License or the Apache License) that allow extensive use and modification with minimal restrictions, to less open or "copyleft" licenses (such as the GNU GPL or the BSD License) that impose conditions on derivative works.3 For example, Sony publishes its MMAudio AI model under the MIT license, expressly allowing the community to freely use, adapt, and improve the technology.10 Similarly, IBM's Granite and OLMo Ai2 models are released under the Apache 2.0 license, which OSI certifies meets its definition of open source artificial intelligence.2

An important legal challenge in the field of artificial intelligence arises from the "multiplier effect" of certain copyleft open source licenses. These licenses require that any code or derivative output of the software under such OSL remain open under the same type of license. This could have major implications in AI, as it could completely open source all or some components of AI models, especially if the AI ​​output qualifies as a derivative of the input data or model.3 A notable example is the FSF's 2008 lawsuit against Cisco Systems for violating the GPL.3

The liability of open source contributors is complicated by the multi-layered nature of open source licenses, which creates a contractual chain between the original upstream developer and downstream users (who can, depending on the applicable open source license, create copies or derivatives). This distributed liability can complicate legal proceedings.3

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has actively evaluated prominent AI models that claim to be "open source". Their analysis concluded that models such as Llama 2 Meta, Microsoft's Phi-2, Mixtral Mistral, and Grok xAI do not meet the OSI definition of open source artificial intelligence, mainly because they lack required components (e.g., full access to training data or model architecture) and/or their legal agreements are inconsistent with the basic principles of open source.2 This highlights a vital and ongoing debate and the need for clarity in the industry.

For internal commercial use of open source models such as Stable Diffusion, it is essential to verify that the specific version of the model is licensed for commercial use and that the content generated complies with copyright laws. While domestic-only use generally faces fewer immediate legal obstacles, consultation with a legal professional is recommended to ensure compliance with specific state laws or guidelines.11

One of the important challenges in the field of open source artificial intelligence is the replicative effect of copyleft licenses, which is considered a major legal and strategic obstacle in productive artificial intelligence. Copyleft licenses, such as the GPL, can require that derivative works also be released as open source.3 This has significant implications in the field of artificial intelligence, where the outputs may be considered derivatives of the input data or the model itself.3 This suggests a direct cause-and-effect relationship: the specific nature of open source licenses (the cause) creates a significant legal risk for organizations, potentially forcing them to open source their proprietary outputs (the cause). This challenge is particularly unique to generative AI and goes beyond traditional software.

This legal complexity is a critical deterrent for companies seeking to adopt specific open source generative AI models, particularly in commercial product development. The unintended risk of opening up valuable intellectual property (such as unique creative content, proprietary data used for fine-tuning) can outweigh the benefits of cost efficiency and greater flexibility. This situation necessitates the development of new AI-specific licensing models that clearly define "derivative effect" in the context of AI outputs. Also, this leads to a strong preference for more open licenses such as MIT or Apache 2.0 (as seen with Sony AI and IBM 2) to reduce this significant legal exposure. This issue will become a key area of ​​legal innovation and industry debate in the coming years.

## IV. Society, rulership and participation

The open source nature of AI fosters a dynamic ecosystem of collaboration and community-driven development, but this requires strong governance structures and clear pathways for participation.

### Development and governance of society

Open source AI development takes place in a transparent and collaborative environment, where source code, models, data, and methodologies are freely available for modification and distribution.6 This approach contrasts with proprietary artificial intelligence, where development and algorithms are heavily protected by individuals or organizations.6

Key characteristics of open source AI include transparency (algorithms, models, and data are available for review), collaboration (developers from diverse backgrounds contribute to AI models and algorithms), accessibility (there are minimal barriers to accessing and using the technology), and innovation (open source encourages rapid iteration and sharing of ideas).6

These features are directly aligned with the principles of ethical AI:

- Transparency and accountability: Open source AI ensures that algorithms and datasets are available for review. This transparency is critical to identifying and correcting biases in AI systems and fosters accountability because developers and users understand how AI makes decisions.6
    
- Diverse and unbiased development: The collaborative nature of open source projects ensures a diverse range of contributors. This diversity is critical to the development of unbiased AI systems, as it brings multiple perspectives to address issues of fairness and representation in AI algorithms.6
    
- Responsible innovation: Open source communities foster innovation by emphasizing ethical considerations. Because these communities often include ethicists, social scientists, and end users, they are more likely to consider the social impact of AI technologies.6
    
- Democratizing Artificial Intelligence: Open source AI democratizes access to AI technologies and ensures that these technologies are not the monopoly of a few powerful entities. This democratization is necessary to prevent monopoly and encourage ethical use.6
    
- Promoting global standards: By fostering an international community of developers and users, open source AI can help create global standards for ethical AI, which is critical given the borderless nature of technology and data.6
    

Open source projects such as BigCode, a community project led by Hugging Face and ServiceNow, are examples of these open governance structures.39 The project focuses on the responsible development of large, open-source language models for code, and has developed tools to control code creators over including their source code in training data and to attribute to developers when models produce close copies of training data.39 Project governance is open and encourages anyone from the community to join working groups or working groups of their interest and contribute to the work and decision-making.39

However, there are also challenges. The quality of open source projects can vary, and establishing strong mechanisms for quality control and standardization is critical to ensure the reliability and safety of these AI systems.6 Also, open source projects often rely on volunteer labor or external funding. Finding sustainable funding and support models is critical to the long-term viability of these projects.6

### How to participate

Participation in open source AI projects, whether in coding or otherwise, is critical to the growth and sustainability of this ecosystem. Several platforms and projects offer clear paths to participation:

- GitHub: It is the main platform for open source projects. To contribute to projects like Stable Diffusion WebUI, users must fork the repository, commit their changes, and submit a pull request.40 Notable open source AI projects on GitHub include Open WebUI MCP (for AI tool integration), OWL (for multi-agent collaboration), and VoiceStar (for fine-grained control in text-to-speech applications).28 GitHub also hosts projects such as TangoFlux (text-to-speech production) and SynCamMaster (multi-camera video production).26

- Post issues: Report bugs or request new features.41
    
- Helping the community: Answer questions, help others in the Hugging Face forum or Discord.41
    
- The technical process includes forking the repository, creating a new branch, developing features, making sure tests pass, formatting the code with tools like black and ruff, and send a pull request.41
    

- OpenCV: This computer vision library also provides avenues for participation. The preferred method is to fork the OpenCV repository on GitHub, apply the changes and create a pull request.44 Contributors are encouraged to add unit tests, tutorials and code samples, and even create short videos to demonstrate their algorithms.45 OpenCV also has a volunteer program for people who want to run OpenCV school meetings and groups, and is supported by grants and institutional memberships.46
    

Participation in these projects not only helps improve tools, but also helps democratize AI and ensure its ethical and responsible development.

## conclusion

The open source AI landscape in multimedia is a dynamic and expanding field characterized by its potential to democratize technology and accelerate innovation. The definition of open source AI extends beyond traditional software code to include datasets, model parameters, and documentation, which requires comprehensive transparency to ensure true compliance with open source principles. The lack of alignment between "open" claims and strict community criteria highlights the need for more careful consideration of permissions and access to model components for users.

The advantages of open source AI, including cost efficiency, unparalleled flexibility, rapid innovation through global collaboration, and transparency, make it a powerful driving force in multimedia development. These benefits directly contribute to lowering barriers to entry and speeding up progress in areas such as image production (Stable Diffusion, FLUX.1), video production and processing (HunyuanVideo, MMAudio), and sound synthesis (GPT-Sovits, MaryTTS).

However, this openness also brings challenges, including lack of dedicated support, hidden operating costs, and security and quality control concerns. In particular, the proliferative effect of copyleft licenses is a major legal and strategic barrier to organizational adoption of generative AI, as it carries the risk of open-sourced proprietary intellectual property. This highlights the need for clearer licensing frameworks and a focus on more liberal licensing.

The future path of open source artificial intelligence is shaped by emerging trends in multimedia. The emergence of multimodal artificial intelligence, which is able to seamlessly process and generate text, image, sound, and 3D content, opens up unprecedented creative opportunities. The expansion of open-source AI systems beyond mere models, along with the increased performance of multi-mode models and a focus on energy efficiency, represents a more mature and sustainable perspective. Increasing collaboration in open source communities and the emergence of commercial opportunities in ethical AI underscore the importance of strong governance and responsible development.

Finally, open source artificial intelligence in multimedia is an area with enormous potential to foster creativity and access on a global scale. However, fully realizing this potential requires careful navigation of its definitional, legal, and operational complexities. Organizations and developers must actively participate in open source communities, carefully evaluate licenses, and adopt strong governance approaches to fully harness the power of open source AI while mitigating its inherent risks.
